    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are intracellular membrane-less accumulations of proteins and other molecules at a higher concentration than the rest of the cell. The recent characterization of condensates as liquid-like assemblies has stimulated profound interest in how physical properties of condensates impact molecular biology. Intriguingly, condensates have been shown to be essential to multiple different cellular processes and underlying aspects of various diseases. Yet, the physics of condensate formation remains unsolved. Here, it is shown that intrinsically disordered protein-protein binding alone provides energetically favorable thermodynamics for condensate formation. The reduction in free energy achieved through increased binding at high condensate concentrations can overcome the entropic cost of de-mixing. Formation of condensates is governed by the ratio of total protein concentration to binding affinity ([protein]total/Kd). Yet, stable condensation is only possible through interactions with rapid binding dynamics. The model prediction and experimental observation that condensates are no longer formed at high [protein]total/Kd ratios redefines our understanding of condensate physics and impact on cellular biology."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Inference and interpretation of evolutionary processes - in particular of the types and targets of natural selection affecting coding sequences, are critically influenced by the assumptions built into statistical models for such analyses. If certain aspects of the substitution process (even when they are not of direct interest) are presumed absent or are modeled with too crude of a simplification, estimates of key model parameters can become biased - often systematically, and lead to poor statistical performance. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of how modeling instantaneous multi-nucleotide (or multi-hit, MH) substitutions impacts dN/dS based inference of episodic diversifying selection at the level of the entire alignment. The inclusion of MH reduces the rate (1.37-fold or 26.8%) at which positive selection is called based on the analysis of N = 9,861 empirical data-sets, while offering significantly better statistical fit to sequence data in 8.37% of cases. Through additional simulation studies, we show that this reduction is not simply due to loss of power because of additional model complexity. After a detailed examination of 21 benchmark alignments and a new high-resolution analysis showing which parts of the alignment provide support for positive selection, we reveal that MH substitutions occurring along shorter branches in the tree are largely responsible for discrepant results in selection detection. Our results add to the growing body of literature which examines decades-old modeling assumptions and finds them to be problematic for biological data analysis. Because multi-nucleotide substitutions have a significant impact on natural selection detection even at the level of an entire gene, we recommend that routine selection analysis of this type consider their inclusion. To facilitate this procedure, we developed a simple model testing selection detection framework able to screen an alignment for positive selection with two biologically important confounding processes: synonymous rate variation, and multi-nucleotide instantaneous substitutions."

    "abstract": "The biological function of natural non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) is tightly bound to their molecular structure. Sequence analyses such as multiple sequence alignments (MSA) are the bread and butter of bio-molecules functional analysis; however, analyzing sequence and structure simultaneously is a difficult task. In this work, we propose CARNAGE (Clustering/Alignment of RNA with Graph-network Embedding), which leverages a graph neural network encoder to imprint structural information into a sequence-like embedding; therefore, downstream sequence analyses now account implicitly for structural constraints. In contrast to the traditional \"supervised\" alignment approaches, we trained our network on a masking problem, independent from the alignment or clustering problem. Our method is very versatile and has shown good performances in 1) designing RNAs sequences, 2) clustering sequences, and 3) aligning multiple sequences only using the simplest Needleman and Wunsch's algorithm. Not only can this approach be readily extended to RNA tridimensional structures, but it can also be applied to proteins."

Bioinformatic prediction and mining of CAZymes improves our understanding of these activities, and enables discovery of candidates of interest for industrial biotechnology, particularly the processing of organic waste for biofuel production. CAZy (www.cazy.org) is a high-quality, manually-curated and authoritative database of CAZymes that is often the starting point for these analyses. Automated querying, and integration of CAZy data with other public datasets would constitute a powerful resource for mining and exploring CAZyme diversity. However, CAZy does not itself provide methods to automate queries, or integrate annotation data from other sources (except by following hyperlinks) to support further analysis. To overcome these limitations we developed cazy_webscraper, a command-line tool that retrieves data from CAZy and other online resources to build a local, shareable, and reproducible database that augments and extends the authoritative CAZy database. cazy_webscraper's integration of curated CAZyme annotations with their corresponding protein sequences, up to date taxonomy assignments, and protein structure data facilitates automated large-scale and targeted bioinformatic CAZyme family analysis and candidate screening. This tool has found widespread uptake in the community, with over 20,000 downloads. We demonstrate the use and application of cazy_webscraper to: (i) augment, update and correct CAZy database accessions; (ii) explore taxonomic distribution of CAZymes recorded in CAZy, identifying underrepresented taxa and unusual CAZy class distributions; and (iii) investigate three CAZymes having potential biotechnological application for degradation of biomass, but lacking a representative structure in the PDB database. We describe in general how cazy_webscraper facilitates functional, structural and evolutionary studies to aid identification of candidate enzymes for further characterisation, and specifically note that CAZy provides supporting evidence for recent expansion of the Auxiliary Activities (AA) CAZy family in eukaryotes, consistent with functions potentially specific to eukaryotic lifestyles."

    "date": "2022-12-03",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "In diverse eukaryotes, DNA methylation is deposited within the coding regions of many genes, termed gene body methylation (GbM). Whereas the role of DNA methylation on the silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA is well understood, gene body methylation is not associated with transcriptional repression, and its biological importance has remained unclear. We report a newly discovered type of GbM in plants, which is under constitutive addition and removal by dynamic methylation modifiers in all cells, including the germline. Methylation at Dynamic GbM genes is removed by the DRDD demethylation pathway, and added by an unknown source of de novo methylation, most likely the maintenance methyltransferase MET1. We show that the Dynamic GbM state is present at homologous genes across divergent lineages (>100 million years), indicating evolutionary conservation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dynamic GbM is tightly associated with the presence of a promoter/regulatory chromatin state within the gene body, in contrast to other gene body methylated genes. Lastly, we find Dynamic GbM is associated with enhanced gene expression plasticity across development and diverse physiological conditions, whereas stably methylated GbM genes exhibit reduced plasticity. We propose that Dynamic GbM is a hallmark of genes that can navigate a greater landscape of transcriptional states by maintaining regulatory flexibility."

    "date": "2022-12-03",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) isone of the most prevalent monogenic human diseases. It is mostly caused by pathogenic variants in PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode interacting transmembrane proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2). Among many pathogenic processes described in ADPKD, those associated with cAMP signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming appear to regulate the disease manifestations. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor-2 antagonist that regulates cAMP pathway, is the only FDA-approved ADPKD therapeutic. Tolvaptan reduces renal cyst growth and kidney function loss, but it is not tolerated by many patients and is associated with idiosyncratic liver toxicity. Therefore, additional therapeutic options for ADPKD treatment are needed. As drug repurposing of FDA-approved drug candidates can significantly decrease the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery, we used the computational approach signature reversion to detect inversely related drug response gene expression signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database and identified compounds predicted to reverse disease-associated transcriptomic signatures in three publicly available kidney transcriptomic data sets of mouse ADPKD models. We focused on a pre-cystic model for signature reversion, as it was less impacted by confounding secondary disease mechanisms in ADPKD, and then compared the resulting candidates' target differential expression in the two cystic mouse models. We further prioritized these drug candidates based on their known mechanism of action, FDA status, targets, and by functional enrichment analysis. With this approach, we prioritized 29 unique drug targets differentially expressed in ADPKD cystic models and 16 prioritized drug repurposing candidates that target them, including bromocriptine and mirtazapine. Collectively, these indicate drug targets and repurposing candidates that may effectively treat pre-cystic as well as cystic ADPKD."

Other than the prevalence of RE in the microTom genome, the biased pattern-transition overwhelmingly outnumbering transversion-rivals that in animals, and may imply an ancient and shared mechanism underlying RE across eukaryotes. We observed conserved RE sites that were always edited under all conditions, and could be considered as \"fixed mutations\" at the RNA level; also we detected conditional RE sites occurring only in specific organ/developmental stage/treatment, possibly suggesting distinct functional roles. Evolutionarily, RE results in sequence diversity at the RNA level and may lead to even functional innovation of proteins, hence may be considered as an additional mechanism to expand gene diversity other than gene duplications and alternative splicing."

    "abstract": "Chloroplast DNA is methylated in the kelp Saccharina japonica, in contrast to most plants. Its function is yet largely unexplored. We detected methylation in the chloroplast DNA of the congener Saccharina latissima, a non - model macroalgal species of high ecological (wild populations) and economical (wild and cultured populations) importance in the North Atlantic. To the functional relevance of chloroplast DNA methylation, we compared for the first time methylation patterns between wild and cultured kelp from different climatic regions (High-Arctic (79 {degrees}N) and temperate (53 {degrees}N), laboratory samples at 5 {degrees}C, 10 {degrees}C and 15 {degrees}C). Our results suggest genome -wide differences in methylated sites, and methylation level, between the climatic regions. At gene level, our data found functions related to photosynthesis to be the predominant affected case only for differential methylation between origins, but not between growth conditions. Here, sample origin led to significant differences between cultivated and wild samples due to differential methylation of genes related to DNA replication in the Spitsbergen samples. Both findings indicate that origin and cultivation strongly affected the chloroplast methylome, but differently. Similar methylomes for samples from the same origin -- independent from whether they grow in the wild or in the lab -- suggest that origin- specific methylation marks on the chloroplast genome are inherited. However, the capacity for rapid adaptation (to cultivation conditions) could be shown for Saccharina latissima during this study. Given that DNA - methylation affects gene expression, our study suggests that lab - cultivation alters epigenetically determined kelp chloroplast characteristics at least to the same degree as ecotypic differentiation does."

We benchmarked our model on a wide variety of datasets and showed that our method generally performed better than competitors, mainly due to an increase of up to 1.4% in the accuracy of heterozygous calls. Moreover, BBmix can be easily incorporated into standard pipelines for calling genotypes. We further show that parameters are generally transferable within datasets, such that a single learning run of less than one hour is sufficient to call genotypes in a large number of samples.

    "abstract": "Neutrophils represent the largest proportion of circulating leukocytes and, in response to inflammatory stimuli, are rapidly recruited to sites of infection where they neutralize pathogens. We have identified a novel neutrophil transcription network induced in response to inflammatory stimuli. We performed the first RNAseq analysis of human neutrophils exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by a meta-analysis of our dataset and previously published studies of LPS-challenged neutrophils. This revealed a robustly enhanced transcriptional network driven by forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors. The network is enriched in genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, including MAFF and ATF3, which are implicated in responses to stress, survival and inflammation. Expression of transcription factors FOXP1 and FOXP4 is induced in neutrophils exposed to inflammatory stimuli, and potential FOXP1/FOXP4 binding sites were identified in several genes in the network, all located in chromatin regions consistent with neutrophil enhancer function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in neutrophils confirmed enhanced binding of FOXP4, but not FOXP1, to multiple sites in response to LPS. Binding to numerous motifs and transactivation of network genes were also observed when FOXP proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. In addition to LPS, the transcriptional network is induced by other inflammatory stimuli, indicating it represents a general neutrophil response to inflammation. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for the FOXP4 transcription network as a regulator of responses to inflammatory stimuli in neutrophils."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT By utilizing the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), recent approaches to prioritizing disease-causing genes for patients become popular. However, these approaches do not comprehensively use information about phenotypes of diseases and patients. We present a new method called Phen2Disease that calculates similarity scores between two phenotype sets of patients and diseases by which to prioritize diseases and genes. Specifically, we calculate three scores of information content-based similarities using the phenotypes, and their combination as the respective benchmarks, and integrate them as a final score. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on six real data cohorts with 2051 cases and two simulated data cohorts with 1000 cases. Compared with the three state-of-the-art methods, if we only use phenotype information and HPO knowledge base, Phen2Disease outperformed all of them, particularly in cohorts with the less average numbers of HPO terms. We have found that patients with higher information content scores had more specific information so their predictions would be more accurate. In addition, Phen2Disease has high interpretability with ranked diseases and patient HPO terms provided."

It is currently limited in proteomic depth, throughput and robustness, a challenge that we address here by a streamlined multiplexed workflow using data-independent acquisition (mDIA). We demonstrate automated and complete dimethyl labeling of bulk or single-cell samples, without losing proteomic depth. In single runs of mammalian cells, a three-plex analysis of tryptic peptides quantified 7,700 proteins per channel. The Lys-N enzyme enables five-plex quantification at MS1 and MS2 level. Because the multiplex channels are quantitatively isolated from each other, mDIA accommodates a reference channel that does not interfere with the target channels. Our algorithm RefQuant takes advantage of this feature and confidently quantifies close to 4,000 proteins in single cells with excellent reproducibility, while our workflow currently allows routine analysis of 80 single cells per day. The concept of stable proteome vs. stochastic transcriptome still holds at this deeper proteome coverage."

    "abstract": "The Golgi is a dynamic organelle with a unique morphology that has implications on its function. How the structural integrity of the Golgi is maintained despite its dynamic nature has been a long-standing question. Several siRNA-based screens have addressed this question and have identified a number of key players required for Golgi integrity. Interestingly, they also reported heterogeneity of phenotypic responses with regards to Golgi morphology. Although never systematically investigated, this variability has generally been attributed to poor transfection efficiency or cell cycle specific responses. Here we show that this heterogeneity is the result of differential response to the siRNA knockdown in different Golgi phenotypes, independent of transfection efficiency or cell cycle phases. To characterize the observed Golgi phenotype-specific responses at the molecular level we have developed an automated assay which enables microscopy-based phenotype classification followed by phenotype-specific single-cell transcriptome analysis. Application of this novel approach to the siRNA mediated knockdown of USO1, a key trafficking protein at the ER to Golgi boundary, surprisingly suggests a key involvement of the late endosomal/endocytic pathways in the regulation of Golgi organization. Our pipeline is the first of its kind developed to study Golgi organization, but can be applied to any biological problem that stands to gain from correlating morphology with single-cell readouts. Moreover, its automated and modular nature allows for uncomplicated scaling up, both in throughput and in complexity, helping the user achieve a systems level understanding of cellular processes."

It provides information about parameter uncertainties, and thereby the reliability of models and their predictions. Yet, generating representative samples from the Bayesian posterior distribution is often computationally challenging. Here, we present an approach that lowers the computational complexity of sample generation for problems with scaling, offset and noise parameters. The proposed method is based on the marginalization of the posterior distribution, which reduces the dimensionality of the sampling problem. We provide analytical results for a broad class of problems and show that the method is suitable for a large number of applications. Subsequently, we demonstrate the benefit of the approach for various application examples from the field of systems biology. We report a substantial improvement up to 50 times in the effective sample size per unit of time, in particular when applied to multi-modal posterior problems. As the scheme is broadly applicable, it will facilitate Bayesian inference in different research fields."

    "abstract": "Recent publications report that although mitochondria population in an axon can be quickly replaced by combination of retrograde and anterograde axonal transport (often within less than 24 h), the axon contains much older mitochondria. This suggests that not all mitochondria that reach the soma are degraded, some of them participate in recirculation. To explain this we developed a model that simulates that a portion of mitochondria that return to the soma are redirected back to the axon rather than being destroyed in somatic lysosomes. Utilizing the developed model, we studied how the percentage of returning mitochondria affects the mean age and age density distributions of mitochondria at different distances from the soma. We also investigated whether turning off the mitochondria anchoring switch can reduce the mean age of mitochondria. For this purpose, we studied the effect of reducing the value of a parameter that characterizes the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary (anchored) state. The reduction of the mean age of mitochondria observed when the chance of mitochondria to get anchored is reduced suggests that some injured neurons may be saved if the percentage of stationary mitochondria is decreased. Replacement of possibly damaged stationary mitochondria with newly synthesized ones may restore energy supply in an injured axon. We also performed a sensitivity study of the mean age of stationary mitochondria to the parameter that determines what portion of mitochondria re-enter the axon and the parameter that determines the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary state."

    "date": "2022-12-03",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Aim: Biologically engineered pacemaker, or bio-pacemaker, is a promising replacement for electronic pacemakers for treating cardiac dysfunction. Previous animal experimental studies, however, have not been able to accurately demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the bio-pacemaker yet. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying factors that affect bio-pacemaker's performance and to discover possible optimising solutions to enable the potential use of bio-pacemaker therapy. Methods and results: The human ventricular myocytes model in this study followed the ten Tussucher's model in 2006, and the bio-pacemaker single cell model was modified based on it as what has been expatiated in our previous work. In tissue model, two factors were primarily evaluated for their effects on bio-pacemakers to pace and drive surrounding cardiac tissue: gap junction between bio-pacemaker cells (PMs) and adjacent ventricular myocytes (VMs) and the spatial distribution of bio-pacemakers. A suppressed gap junctional electrical coupling between and heterotypic gap junctions were simulated and a combination of them led to the best performance of the bio-pacemaker. Then, the pacemaking behaviours of three kinds of idealised PM-VM slices were simulated, in which an electrically isolated distribution of bio-pacemaker showed optimal drive capacities. Finally, a real human ventricular slice model was used to verified the conclusions in idealized tissues. Conclusion: This study develops a theory that weak-rectified electrical coupling and electrically isolated distribution can enhance the pacemaking efficiency of bio-pacemakers, which lays the groundwork for future research into therapeutic applications of bio-pacemakers."

    "abstract": "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is successfully used for the quantitative investigation of the cellular mechanosensing of the microenvironment. To this purpose, several force spectroscopy approaches aim at measuring the adhesive forces between two living cells and also between a cell and a suitable reproduction of the extracellular matrix (ECM), typically exploiting tips suitably functionalised with single components (e.g. collagen, fibronectin) of the ECM. However, these probes only poorly reproduce the complexity of the native cellular microenvironment and consequently of the biological interactions. We developed a novel approach to produce AFM probes that faithfully reproduce the structural and biochemical complexity of the ECM; this was achieved by attaching to an AFM cantilever a micrometric slice of native decellularised ECM cut by laser microdissection, and preserving the full morphological, mechanical, and chemical heterogeneity of the ECM. These native ECM probes can be used in force spectroscopy experiments aimed at targeting cell-microenvironment interactions. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of dissecting mechanotransductive cell-ECM interactions in the 10 pN range. As proof-of-principle, we tested a rat bladder ECM probe against the AY-27 rat bladder cancer cell line. On the one hand, we obtained reproducible results using different probes derived from the same ECM regions; on the other hand, we detected differences in the adhesion patterns of distinct bladder ECM regions, such as submucosa and detrusor, in line with the disparities in composition and biophysical properties of these ECM regions. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to use native ECM probes, produced from patient-specific regions of organs and tissues, to investigate cell-microenvironment interactions and early mechanotransductive processes by force spectroscopy. This opens new possibilities in the field of personalised medicine."

    "abstract": "Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has become a leading standard in high-resolution imaging of living samples in 2- and 3-dimensions. Biological samples are however not restricted to a single observation plane and several molecular processes evolve rapidly in 3D. The conventional mechanical scanning required in LSFM limits the range of observable dynamics and are usually restricted in resolution. Here we introduce a new strategy for instantaneous volumetric excitation and volumetric imaging of single-molecules in cell aggregates. The technique combines, for the first time, the use of light sheet microscopy and multifocus microscopy (MFM) and enables a volumetric 4D imaging of biological samples with single-molecule resolution. We engineered the excitation beam to yield a modular and uniform excitation matching the observable detection range of MFM. The strength of the method is highlighted with examples of single-molecule 3D tracking and 3D super-resolution imaging in multicellular samples."

    "abstract": "Mechanical properties of an aneurysmatic thoracic aorta are potential markers of future growth and remodeling and can help to estimate risk of rupture. Aortic geometries obtained from routine medical imaging do not display wall stress distribution and mechanical properties. Mechanical properties for a given vessel may be determined from medical images at different physiological pressures using inverse finite element analysis. However, without considering pre-stresses, the estimation of mechanical properties will lack accuracy. In the present paper, we propose and evaluate a mechanical parameter identification technique, which recovers pre-stresses by determining the zero-pressure configuration of the aortic geometry. We first validated the method on a cylindrical geometry and subsequently applied it to a realistic aortic geometry. Verification of the assessed parameters was performed using synthetically generated reference data for both geometries. The method was able to estimate the true mechanical properties with an accuracy ranging from 98% to 99%."

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifications play a fundamental role in controlling transcription and genome stability and yet despite their importance, are poorly understood in early-diverging fungi. We present the first comprehensive study of histone-lysine and DNA methyltransferases across the Mucoromycota, uncovering H3K9-methylated heterochromatin as the major chromatin modification repressing transcription in these fungi, which lack both Polycomb silencing and cytosine methylation. Although RNA interference (RNAi) facilitates the formation of heterochromatin in many eukaryotic organisms, we show that RNAi is not required to maintain either genomic or centromeric heterochromatin in Mucor. H3K9-methylation and RNAi act independently to control centromeric regions, suggesting a functional sub-specialization. Whereas the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and heterochromatin formation are essential for cell viability, RNAi is dispensable for viability yet acts as the main epigenetic, regulatory force repressing transposition of GremLINE1 elements. Mutations inactivating canonical RNAi lead to rampant transposition and insertional inactivation of targets resulting in antimicrobial drug resistance. This fine-tuned, Rdrp2-dependent RNAi activity is critical for genome stability, restricting GremLINE1 transposable elements to the centromeres where they occupy long heterochromatic islands. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi and heterochromatin formation are independent genome defense and regulatory mechanisms in the Mucorales, contributing to a paradigm shift from the co-transcriptional gene silencing observed in fission yeasts to models in which heterochromatin and RNAi operate independently in early-diverging basal fungi."

We discovered that patients harboring DNMT3A and TET2 CH mutations at baseline and in response to IL-6 stimulation confer a pro-inflammatory profile to CD14+ monocytes through previously unrecognized pathways including Macrophage Inhibitory Factor (MIF). A germline genetic variant in MIF modifies TET2 CH cardiovascular disease risk. Using mitochondrial lineage tracing, we used a novel method to compare gene expression between mutated and non-mutated cells within individual CH patients. We found that the mutated CH monocytes, but not non-mutated monocytes are pro-inflammatory, explaining why patients with larger CH clones have increased cardiovascular disease risk."

Here, we develop genetically immortalized bovine satellite cells (iBSCs) via constitutive expression of bovine Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). These cells achieve over 120 doublings at the time of publication and maintain their capacity for myogenic differentiation.

While these diseases have different underlying causes, they share defects in cell-cell adhesion in the epidermis and desmosome organization. Objective: To better understand the underlying mechanisms leading to disease in these conditions we performed RNA-seq on lesional skin samples from Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease patients. Methods: RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis were performed on banked paraffin embedded diagnostic samples from each disease. Results: The transcriptomic profiles of Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease were found to share a remarkable overlap, which did not extend to other common inflammatory skin diseases, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Analysis of enriched pathways showed a shared upregulation in keratinocyte differentiation and Th17 inflammatory pathways, and a decrease in cell adhesion and actin organization pathways in Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease. Direct comparison to atopic dermatitis and psoriasis showed that the downregulation in actin organization pathways was a unique feature in Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease. Further, upstream regulator analysis suggests that a decrease in SRF/MRTF activity may be responsible for the downregulation of actin organization pathways. Staining for MRTFA in lesional skin samples showed a decrease in nuclear MRTFA in patient skin compared to normal skin. Conclusion: These findings highlight the significant level of similarity in the transcriptome of Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease, and identify decreases in actin organization pathways as a unique signature present in these conditions."

    "abstract": "1Natural movement is clearly related to health, however, it is also highly complex and difficult to measure. Most attempts to measure it focus on functional movements in humans, and while this a valid and popular approach, assays focussed on particular movements cannot capture the range of natural movement that occurs outside them. It is also difficult to use current techniques to compare movement across different animal species. This type of interspecies comparison may be useful for identifying conserved computational principles of movement that guide human and veterinary medicine, plus several other fields of research. It is therefore important that research develops a system for quantifying movement in freely moving animals in natural environments and relating it to length and quality of life. The present text proposes a theoretical framework for doing so, within which movement is defined as movement ability (MA). MA is comprised of three major variables - Movement Quality, Movement Complexity, and Movement Quantity - that may be used to capture what are perhaps the most important components of movement as it relates to length and quality of life. The framework requires validation, however, it represents a novel and potentially important paradigm for considering movement, which may influence how present and future work is conducted."

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR-seq) has provided numerous human immunoglobulin (IG) sequences allowing specific B cell receptor (BCR) studies such as the antigen-driven evolution of antibodies (IG secreted molecules). AIRR-seq data allows researchers to examine intra-clonal differences caused primarily by affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation processes. Understating the diversity of antibodies and how they evolve could help elucidate the generation of antibodies with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Consequently, retracing their evolutionary history could also help to clarify how vaccines or pathogen exposition drive the humoral immune response. Computational methods are necessary for large-scale evaluation of AIRR-seq properties. Currently, there is no efficient and interactive tool for analyzing intra-clonal diversity, permitting users to explore AIRR-seq data and potentially discover discriminating clonal features. We developed ViCloD, a web server for large-scale visual analysis of repertoire clonality and intra-clonal diversity. ViCloD uses data preprocessed by IMGT and performs evolutionary and statistical analyses, producing a set of valuable plots. The web server presents diverse functionalities, including repertoire navigation, clonal abundance analysis, and intra-clonal evolutionary tree reconstruction. Users can download the analyzed data in different table formats and save the generated plots as image files. ViCloD is a versatile analytical tool that can help researchers and clinicians in their investigations involving clonal diversity analysis. It is user-friendly, simple, accessible, and open to all users. Moreover, its pipeline is optimized to process hundreds of thousands of sequences in a few minutes, allowing intra-clonal diversity analysis in large and complex repertoires."

We used a combination of experimental and computational studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation on the molecular dynamics and structure of [Aurora B/IN-box]. In addition, we generated partially phosphorylated intermediates to analyze the contribution of each phosphorylation independently. We found that the dynamics of Aurora and IN-box are interconnected, and IN-box plays both positive and negative regulatory roles depending on the phosphorylation status of the enzyme complex. Phosphorylation in the activation loop of Aurora B occurs intramolecularly and prepares the enzyme complex for activation, but two phosphorylated sites are synergistically responsible for full enzyme activity."

However, tissue penetration can still be an issue due to both scattering and spherical aberrations induced on highly focused beams by the tissue. The use of low numerical aperture objectives to pass through the outer layers of the skin, together with high dioptric power microlenses implanted in-vivo close to the observation volume, can be beneficial to the reduction of the optical aberrations. Here, we develop and test, on a monolayer of fibroblast cells, plano-convex micro-lenses to be used for non-linear imaging of biological tissue. The microlenses can be used as single lenses or multiplexed in an array. A thorough test of the wave front of the lenses is reported together with their modulation transfer function and wave front profile. Notably, we could retrieve magnified fluorescence images through the microlenses coupled to commercial confocal and two-photon excitation raster scanning microscopes. The signal to noise ratio of the images is not substantially affected by the use of the microlenses and the magnification can be adjusted by the relative position of the microlens array to the microscope objective and the immersion medium. These results are opening the way to the application of implanted micro-optics for optical in-vivo inspection of biological processes."

    "abstract": "Local and global inference methods have been developed to infer structural contacts from multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins. They rely on correlations in amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Because homologous proteins share a common ancestry, their sequences also feature phylogenetic correlations, which can impair contact inference. We investigate this effect by generating controlled synthetic data from a minimal model where the importance of contacts and of phylogeny can be tuned. We demonstrate that global inference methods, specifically Potts models, are more resilient to phylogenetic correlations than local methods, based on covariance or mutual information. This holds whether or not phylogenetic corrections are used, and may explain the success of global methods. We analyse the roles of selection strength and of phylogenetic relatedness. We show that sites that mutate early in the phylogeny yield false positive contacts. We consider natural data and realistic synthetic data, and our findings generalise to these cases. Our results highlight the impact of phylogeny on contact prediction from protein sequences and illustrate the interplay between the rich structure of biological data and inference."

    "abstract": "As an important group of proteins discovered in phages, anti-CRISPR inhibits the activity of the immune system of bacteria (i.e., CRISPR-Cas), showing great potential for gene editing and phage therapy. However, the prediction and discovery of anti-CRISPR are challenging for its high variability and fast evolution. Existing biological studies often depend on known CRISPR and anti-CRISPR pairs, which may not be practical considering the huge number of pairs in reality. Computational methods usually struggle with prediction performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel deep neural network for anti-CRISPR analysis (AcrNET), which achieves impressive performance. On both the cross-fold and cross-dataset validation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods significantly. Impressively, AcrNET improves the prediction performance by at least 15% regarding the F1 score for the cross-dataset test. Moreover, AcrNET is the first computational method to predict the detailed anti-CRISPR classes, which may help illustrate the anti-CRISPR mechanism. Taking advantage of a Transformer protein language model pre-trained on 250 million protein sequences, AcrNET overcomes the data scarcity problem. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that Transformer model feature, evolutionary feature, and local structure feature complement each other, which indicates the critical properties of anti-CRISPR proteins. Combined with AlphaFold prediction, further motif analysis and docking experiments demonstrate that AcrNET captures the evolutionarily conserved pattern and the interaction between anti-CRISPR and the target implicitly. With the impressive prediction capability, AcrNET can serve as a valuable tool for anti-CRISPR study and new anti-CRISPR discovery, with a free webserver at https://proj.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/aihlab/AcrNET/."

Multiplexed detection of genomic DNA from different species in complex samples can be achieved by coupling the sensing mechanism to orthogonal fluorescent reporters. We also demonstrate that the DNA sensors can detect the presence of species in the complex samples without requiring DNA extraction. The modularity of the living cell-based DNA sensing mechanism and simple detection procedure could enable programmable DNA sensing for broad applications."

Low-intensity ultrasound provides noninvasive and practical means to deliver drugs from nanocarriers selectively into its focus. However, which nanocarriers and ultrasound parameters can provide effective and safe drug delivery has been unclear. We found that nanocarriers with highly stable perfluorocarbon cores mediate effective release so long as they are activated by ultrasound of relatively low frequencies. We further demonstrated a repeatable method for manufacturing these nanocarriers to help facilitate future work in this area. This study guides the formulation and release parameters for effective and safe drug delivery into specific parts of the body or brain regions."

Native DNA was sequenced on a MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing device to generate genome assemblies for 7 major chrY human haplogroups. We analyzed and compared the chrY enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications amongst the considered haplogroups. Altogether, we provide a framework to study complex genomic regions with a simple, fast, and affordable methodology that could be applied to larger population genomics datasets."

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genomic loci associated with complex traits. Genetic fine-mapping aims to detect independent causal variants from the GWAS-identified loci, adjusting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. The use of GWAS summary statistics and an adequate LD reference enable large sample sizes for fine-mapping, without direct access to individual-level data. We present FiniMOM (fine-mapping using a product inverse-moment priors), a novel Bayesian fine-mapping method for summarized genetic associations. For causal effects, the method uses a non-local inverse-moment prior, which is a natural prior distribution to model non-null effects in finite samples. A beta-binomial prior is set for the number of causal variants, with a parameterization that can be used to control for potential misspecifications in the LD reference. We test the performance of our method against a current state-of-the-art fine-mapping method SuSiE (sum-of-single-effects) across a range of simulated scenarios aimed to mimic a typical GWAS on circulating protein levels, and an applied example. The results show improved credible set coverage and power of the proposed method, especially in the case of multiple causal variants within a locus. The superior performance and the flexible parameterization to control for misspecified LD reference make FiniMOM a competitive alternative to other fine-mapping methods for summarized genetic data."

From this an evolutionary-inspired eXchange Unit between T domains (XUT) approach was developed, which allows the assembly of NRPS fragments over a broad range of GC contents, protein similarities, and extender unit specificities, as was shown for the specific production of a proteasome inhibitor, designed and assembled from five different NRPS fragments."

    "abstract": "Motivation: Advances in sequencing technologies have led to a surge in genomic data, although the functions of many gene products coded by these genes remain unknown. While in-depth, targeted experiments that determine the functions of these gene products are crucial and routinely performed, they fail to keep up with the inflow of novel genomic data. In an attempt to address this gap, high-throughput experiments are being conducted in which a large number of genes are investigated in a single study. The annotations generated as a result of these experiments are generally biased towards a small subset of less informative Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Identifying and removing biases from protein function annotation databases is important since biases impact our understanding of protein function by providing a poor picture of the annotation landscape. Additionally, as machine learning methods for predicting protein function are becoming increasingly prevalent, it is essential that they are trained on unbiased datasets. Therefore, it is not only crucial to be aware of biases, but also to judiciously remove them from annotation datasets. Results: We introduce GOThresher, a Python tool that identifies and removes biases in function annotations from protein function annotation databases. Implementation and Availability: GOThresher is written in Python and released via PyPI https://pypi.org/project/gothresher/ and on the Bioconda Anaconda channel https://anaconda.org/bioconda/gothresher.

High predictive performance due to the modelling of dependencies within and between regulatory sequences is an enabler for biological discoveries in gene regulation through model interpretation techniques. To understand the regulatory code that delineates gene expression, we have designed a novel deep-learning model (CRMnet) to predict gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our model outperforms the current benchmark models and achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.971. Interpretation of informative genomic regions determined from model saliency maps, and overlapping the saliency maps with known yeast motifs, support that our model can successfully locate the binding sites of transcription factors that actively modulate gene expression. We compare our model's training times on a large compute cluster with GPUs and Google TPUs to indicate practical training times on similar datasets."

    "abstract": "Spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins is an integral step in the process of cellular Protein Quality Control (PQC). is essential for cellular health. One key PQC strategy relies on spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins into protein inclusions. Herein we define the coordination of nuclear and cytoplasmic spatial PQC. While cytoplasmic misfolded proteins concentrate in a cytoplasmic, perinuclear Juxta Nuclear Quality control (JUNQ) compartment, nuclear misfolded proteins sequester into a perinucleolar IntraNuclear Quality control (INQ) compartment. Particle tracking analysis reveals that INQ and JUNQ converge to localize to face each other across the nuclear envelope at a site proximal to the Nuclear-Vacuolar Junctions (NVJ). Strikingly, this convergence is coordinated by a perinuclear ESCRT pathway involving nuclear envelope-localized ESCRT-II/-III protein Chm7. Indeed, deleting the NVJ or ATPase Vsp4, required for membrane invagination into the vacuole, impairs clearance of inclusions. Furthermore, deleting other ESCRT components led to cytoplasmic accumulation of nuclear misfolded proteins. Our findings uncover an alternative role of perinuclear ESCRT and the nuclear envelope in coordinating spatial PQC and clearance of nuclear and cytoplasmic misfolded proteins into the vacuole."

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements can encode a wide variety of genes that support their own stability and mobility as well as genes that provide accessory functions to their hosts. Such genes can be adopted from host chromosomes and can be exchanged with other mobile elements. Due to their accessory nature, the evolutionary trajectories of these genes can differ from those of essential host genes. The mobilome therefore provides a rich source of genetic innovation. We previously described a new type of primase encoded by S. aureus SCCmec elements that is composed of an A-family polymerase catalytic domain in complex with a small second protein that confers single-stranded DNA binding. Here we use new structure prediction methods in conjunction with sequence database searches to show that related primases are widespread among putative mobile genetic elements in the Firmicutes. Structure predictions show that the second protein adopts an OB fold (common among single - stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins) and these predictions were far more powerful than simple sequence comparisons in identifying its homologs. The protein-protein interaction surface varies among these polymerase - SSB complexes and appears to have arisen repeatedly by exploiting partial truncations of the polymerase's N-terminal accessory domains."

However, unmatched results have been reported when selected enhancers are silenced in situ. In this study, using genomic deletion analysis in mice, we investigated the roles of two previously identified enhancers and the promoter of the Rho gene that codes for the visual pigment rhodopsin. The Rho gene is robustly expressed by rod photoreceptors of the retina, and essential for the subcellular structure and visual function of rod photoreceptors. Mutations in RHO cause severe vision loss in humans. We found that each Rho regulatory region can independently mediate local epigenomic changes, but only the promoter is absolutely required for establishing active Rho chromatin configuration and transcription and maintaining the cell integrity and function of rod photoreceptors. To our surprise, two Rho enhancers that enable strong promoter activation in reporter assays are largely dispensable for Rho expression in vivo. Only small and age-dependent impact is detectable when both enhancers are deleted. Our results demonstrate context-dependent roles of enhancers and highlight the importance of studying functions of cis-regulatory regions in the native genomic context."

In this study, we generated a systematic panel of transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using a variety of oncogenic transgenes, and discovered transformed cell lines that remain compatible with reprogramming when transfected with Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/Myc. By comparing the reprogramming-capable and incapable transformed lines we identified multiple stages of failure in the reprogramming process. Some transformed lines failed very early, whilst other lines seemed to progress through a normal-looking reprogramming process. Finally, we show that MEK inhibition overcomes one critical reprogramming barrier by indirectly suppressing a hyperactive epigenetic state in some of the transformed cells. This study reveals that the barriers underlying resistance to reprogramming vary between the different transformation methods."

While it is well established that post-transcriptional regulation plays a significant role in EMT, the extent of alternative polyadenylation (APA) during EMT has not yet been explored. Using 3' end anchored RNA sequencing, we mapped the alternative polyadenylation landscape (APA) following TGF-{beta}-mediated induction of EMT in human mammary epithelial cells and found APA generally causes 3'UTR lengthening during this cell state transition. Analysis of the RNA-binding protein Quaking (QKI), a splicing factor induced during EMT, revealed enrichment of its binding adjacent to cleavage and polyadenylation sites within 3'UTRs. Following QKI knockdown, APA of many transcripts are altered to produce predominantly shorter 3'UTRs associated with reduced gene expression. Among these, QKI binds to its own cleavage site to produce a transcript with a longer 3'UTR. These findings reveal extensive changes in APA occur during EMT and identify a novel function for QKI in this process."

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped over 90% of disease- or trait-associated variants within the non-coding genome, like cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genomic variants that can change how DNA-binding regulatory proteins, like transcription factors (TFs), interact with the genome and regulate gene expression. NKX2-5 is a TF essential for proper heart development, and mutations affecting its function have been associated with congenital heart diseases (CHDs). However, establishing a causal mechanism between non-coding genomic variants and human disease remains challenging. To address this challenge, we identified 8,475 SNPs predicted to alter NKX2-5 DNA-binding using a position weight matrix (PWM)-based predictive model. Five variants were prioritized for in vitro validation; four of them are associated with traits and diseases that impact cardiovascular health. The impact of these variants on NKX2-5 binding was evaluated with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using recombinantly expressed and purified human NKX2-5 homeodomain. Binding curves were constructed to determine changes in binding between variant and reference alleles. Variants rs7350789, rs7719885, rs747334, and rs3892630 increased binding affinity, whereas rs61216514 decreased binding by NKX2-5 when compared to the reference genome. Our findings suggest that differential TF-DNA binding affinity can be key in establishing a causal mechanism of pathogenic variants."

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 capsid houses the viral genome and interacts extensively with host cell proteins throughout the viral life cycle. It is composed of capsid protein (CA), which assembles into a conical fullerene lattice composed of roughly 200 CA hexamers and 12 CA pentamers. Previous structural analyses of individual CA hexamers and pentamers have provided valuable insight into capsid structure and function, but high-resolution information about these assemblies in the broader context of the capsid lattice is lacking. In this study, we combined cryo-electron tomography and single particle analysis cryo-electron microscopy to determine high-resolution structures of continuous regions of the capsid lattice containing both hexamers and pentamers. We also developed a new method of in vitro lattice assembly that enabled us to directly study the lattice under a wider range of conditions than has previously been possible. Using this approach, we identified a critical role for inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in pentamer formation and determined the structure of the CA lattice bound to the capsid-targeting antiretroviral drug GS-6207 (Lenacapvir). Our work reveals new structural details of the mature HIV-1 CA lattice and establishes the combination of lattice templating and single particle analysis as a robust strategy for studying retroviral capsid structure and capsid interactions with host proteins and antiviral compounds."

Because viral burden distributions determined from community survey data can be biased due to the impact of variant epidemiology on the time-since-infection of samples, we developed a method to explicitly adjust observed Ct value distributions to account for the expected bias. Analysing the adjusted Ct values using partial least squares regression, we found that among unvaccinated individuals with no known prior infection, the average Ct value was 0.94 lower among Alpha variant infections, compared those with the predecessor strain, B.1.177. However, among vaccinated individuals, it was 0.34 lower among Delta variant infections, compared to those with the Alpha variant. In addition, the average Ct value decreased by 0.20 for every 10 year age increment of the infected individual. In summary, within-host viral burdens are associated with age, in addition to the interplay of vaccination status and viral variant."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "The properties of single microtubules within the microtubule network can be modulated through posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation within the lumen of microtubules. To access the lumen, the enzymes could either enter through the microtubule ends or at damage sites along the microtubule shaft. Here we show that the acetylation profile depends on damage sites, which can be caused by the motor protein kinesin-1. Indeed, the entry of the deacetylase HDAC6 into the microtubule lumen depends on kinesin-1-induced damage sites. In contrast, activity of the microtubule acetylase TAT1 is independent of kinesin-1 and shaft damage. On a cellular level, our results show that microtubule acetylation distributes in an exponential gradient. This gradient results from tight regulation of microtubule (de-)acetylation and scales with the size of the cells. The control of shaft damage represents a novel mechanism to regulate PTM inside the microtubule by giving access to the lumen."

    "date": "2022-12-02",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Background: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation is the principal event in the development of liver fibrosis in which succinate-GPR91 signaling has recently been shown to be a contributor. Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to involve in HSC activation, but its association with succinate in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the role of gemigliptin, an antidiabetic DDP-4 inhibitor, in the succinate-induced ER stress and activation of HSCs. Methods: LX-2 cells, the immortalized human HSCs, were treated with succinate and gemigliptin. For animal experiments, C57BL/6N mice were divided into 3 groups: control diet, high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet, and HFHC diet mixed with gemigliptin. Results: Succinate significantly induced HSC activation and increased expression of inflammatory markers and the increase in the migration of HSCs. The treatment of succinate also caused ER dilation and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling as PERK, eIF2alpha, Bip, suggesting increasing ER stress in HSCs. All responses of HSCs to succinate were attenuated with the co-treatment of gemigliptin. Moreover, the exposure of HSCs to tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, promoted the expression of -SMA, proliferation and migration of HSCs. In vivo, the level of fibrotic and ER stress markers was increased in mice fed with HFHC diet and the administration of gemigliptin improved these changes in HFHC-induced mice. Conclusion: This study showed the involvement of ER stress in the activation of succinate-induced LX-2 HSCs and gemigliptin significantly reduced ER stress in HSC activation. Therefore, gemigliptin may become an anti-fibrotic agent and targeting to succinate and ER stress may be a promising therapeutic in the management of liver fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Accumulation of R-loops, which are transcriptional by-products, poses a persistent threat to genome integrity and are implicated in accelerated ageing and cancer. PSIP1/LEDGF is a chromatin protein, shown to have histone chaperone activity and interact with transcriptional elongation complex. Here, we demonstrated that PSIP1 interacts with R-loops and with the factors involved in R-loop resolution, including PARP1. Reduced PSIP1 levels in human and mouse cells increase R-loop and DNA damage levels at the PSIP1 binding sites. This increased R-loops and DNA damage was specific at the RNA polymerase II transcription sites, causing local transcriptional arrest and reduced replication rate. In addition, we demonstrate that targeting PSIP1 increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to PARP1 inhibitors and transcription-coupled DNA-damaging agents. Overall, our findings reveal the critical role of PSIP1 in maintaining genome stability by reducing the R-loop burden and DNA damage at the transcriptionally active regions of the genome."

Ectopic huLiver tumors were generated through subcutaneous injection of the HC-04 cell line and shown to be infectible by both freshly dissected sporozoites and through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Evidence for complete LS development was supported by the transition to blood-stage infection in mice engrafted with human erythrocytes. Additionally, this model was successfully evaluated for its utility in testing antimalarial therapeutics, as supported by primaquine acting as a causal prophylactic against P. falciparum. Presented here is a new platform for the study of human Plasmodium infection with the potential to aid in drug discovery."

    "abstract": "The nuclear lamina (NL) is a complex network of nuclear lamins and lamin-associated nuclear membrane proteins, which scaffold the nucleus to maintain structural integrity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Nuclear Matrix Constituent Proteins (NMCPs) are essential components of the NL and are required to maintain the structural integrity of the nucleus and specific perinuclear chromatin anchoring. At the nuclear periphery, suppressed chromatin overlapping with repetitive sequences and inactive protein-coding genes are enriched. At a chromosomal level, plant chromatin organization in interphase nuclei displays flexibilities in response to various developmental cues and environmental stimuli. Based on these observations in Arabidopsis, and given the role of AtNMCP genes (CRWN1 and CRWN4) in organizing chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery, one can expect considerable changes in chromatin-NL interactions when the global chromatin organization patterns are being altered in plants. Here, we report the highly flexible nature of plant nuclear lamina, which disassembles substantially under various stress conditions. Particularly, under heat stress, we reveal that chromatin domains, initially tethered to the nuclear envelope, remain largely associated with CRWN1 and become scattered in the inner nuclear space. Via investigating the three-dimensional chromatin contact network, we further reveal that CRWN1 proteins play a structural role in shaping the changes in genome folding under heat stress. Also, CRWN1 acts as a negative transcriptional co-regulator to modulate the shift of the plant transcriptome profile in response to heat stress."

Conventional genome browsers display data/annotations on a single reference genome/assembly; there are also genomic alignment viewer/browsers that help users visualize alignment, mismatch, and rearrangement between syntenic regions. However, there is a growing need for a comparative epigenome browser that can display genomic and epigenomic datasets across different species and enable users to compare them between syntenic regions. Here, we present the WashU Comparative Epigenome Browser (http://comparativegateway.wustl.edu). It allows users to load functional genomic datasets/annotations mapped to different genomes and display them over syntenic regions simultaneously. The browser also displays genetic differences between the genomes from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to structural variants (SVs) to visualize the association between epigenomic differences and genetic differences. Instead of anchoring all datasets to the reference genome coordinates, it creates independent coordinates of different genome assemblies to faithfully present features and data mapped to different genomes. It uses a simple, intuitive genome-align track to illustrate the syntenic relationship between different species. It extends the widely used WashU Epigenome Browser infrastructure and can be expanded to support multiple species. This new browser function will greatly facilitate comparative genomic/epigenomic research, as well as support the recent growing needs to directly compare and benchmark the T2T CHM13 assembly and other human genome assemblies."

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded biosensors based on fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used to monitor dynamics and sub-cellular spatial distribution of calcium ion (Ca2+) fluxes and their role in intracellular signaling pathways. The development of different mutations in the Ca2+-sensitive elements of the cameleon probes has allowed sensitive range of Ca2+ measurements in almost all cellular compartments. Region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethered to mitochondria, named as the mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), has received an extended attention since the last 5 years. Indeed, as MAMs are essential for calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, molecular tools have been developed to assess quantitatively Ca2+ levels in the MAMs. However, sensitivity of the first generation Ca2+ biosensors on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM)do not allow to measure M or sub-M changes in Ca2+ concentration which prevents to measure the native activity (unstimulated exogenously) of endogenous channels. In this study, we assembled a new ratiometric highly sensitive Ca2+ biosensor expressed on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM). It allows the detection of smaller differences than the previous biosensor in or at proximity of the MAMs. Noteworthy, we demonstrated that IP3-receptors have an endogenous activity which participate to the Ca2+ leak channel on the surface of the OMM during hypoxia or when SERCA activity is blocked."

From immune cell (haemocyte) reactivity and the production of antimicrobial factors, these insects share many functional similarities with mammalian innate immunity. After exposing insects to UVA or UVB, we monitored larval viability, susceptibility to infection, haemolymph (blood) physiology and faecal discharge. Prolonged exposure of larvae to UVB coincided with decreased survival, enhanced susceptibility to bacterial challenge, melanin synthesis in the haemolymph, compromised haemocyte functionality and changes in faecal (bacterial) content. We contend G. mellonella is a reliable in vivo model for assessing the impact of UV exposure at the whole organism and cellular levels."

Accessing this potential has been challenging for computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to host function. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems based on random graph neural networks that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, equivariant layers for efficiently synthesizing 3D structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries, and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. We suggest that Chroma can effectively realize protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics, and even natural language prompts. With this unified approach, we hope to accelerate the prospect of programming protein matter for human health, materials science, and synthetic biology."

Current mapping methods fail to finely estimate the local quality, challenging to associate the SR scale content. Here, we develop a rolling Fourier ring correlation (rFRC) framework to evaluate the reconstruction uncertainties down to SR scale. To visually pinpoint regions with low reliability, a filtered rFRC is combined with a modified resolution scaled error map (RSM), offering a comprehensive and concise map for further examination. We demonstrate their performances on various SR imaging modalities, and the resulting quantitative maps enable better SR images integrated from different reconstructions. Beyond that, we provide a strategy for learning-based restorations, allowing a direct detection of both data and model uncertainties, and expect the representative cases can inspire further advances in this rapidly developing field."

Biomappings implements a curation cycle workflow for missing mappings which combines automated prediction with human-in-the-loop curation.

Predicted and curated mappings are made available in public, version controlled resource files on GitHub. Biomappings currently makes available 8,560 curated mappings, and 41,178 predicted ones, providing previously missing mappings between widely used resources covering small molecules, cell lines, diseases and other concepts.

However, existing regulations on genomic data sharing and the sheer size of the data limit the scope of such collaborations. Although cryptographic tools for secure computation promise to enable collaborative studies with formal privacy guarantees, existing approaches either are computationally impractical or support only simplified analysis pipelines. Here, we introduce secure and federated genome-wide association studies (SF-GWAS), a novel combination of secure computation frameworks that empowers efficient and accurate GWAS in a federated manner, i.e., on private data locally-held by multiple entities, while provably ensuring end-to-end data confidentiality. Another key advance is that we designed SF-GWAS to support the two most widely-used GWAS pipelines---those based on principal component analysis (PCA) or linear mixed models (LMMs). We ran SF-GWAS on five real GWAS datasets, including a large UK Biobank cohort of 410K individuals, thereby demonstrating the largest secure genetics collaboration to date. SF-GWAS achieves an order-of-magnitude runtime improvement over the prior art for PCA-based GWAS and newly allows secure LMM-based association tests, for which its runtime scales at a near-constant rate in cohort size. Our work realizes the power of secure, collaborative, and accurate GWAS at unprecedented scale and should be applicable to a broad range of analyses.

    "abstract": "A performance metric is a tool to measure the correctness of a trained Machine Learning (ML) model. Numerous performance metrics have been developed for classification problems making it overwhelming to select the appropriate one since each of them represents a particular aspect of the model. Furthermore, selection of a performance metric becomes harder for problems with imbalanced and/or small datasets. Therefore, in clinical studies where datasets are frequently imbalanced and, in situations when the prevalence of a disease is low or the collection of patient samples is difficult, deciding on a suitable metric for performance evaluation of an ML model becomes quite challenging. The most common approach to address this problem is measuring multiple metrics and compare them to identify the best-performing ML model. However, comparison of multiple metrics is laborious and prone to user preference bias. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are also required by ML model optimization techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, where we train many models, each with different parameters, and compare their performances to identify the best-performing parameters. In such situations, it becomes almost impossible to assess different models by comparing multiple metrics. Here, we propose a new metric called Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) as a Python package for classification problems. MLcps combines multiple pre-computed performance metrics into one metric that conserves the essence of all pre-computed metrics for a particular model. We tested MLcps on 4 different publicly available biological datasets and the results reveal that it provides a comprehensive picture of overall model robustness. MLcps is available at https://pypi.org/project/MLcps/ and cases of use are available at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/FunctionalUrology/MLcps.git/main."

A typical procedure in the analysis is to delineate individual cells, classify them into cell types, and analyze their spatial relationships. All steps come with a number of challenges, and to address them and identify the bottlenecks of the analysis, it is necessary to include quality control tools in the analysis workflow. This makes it possible to optimize the steps and adjust settings in order to get better and more precise results. Additionally, the development of automated approaches for tissue analysis requires visual verification to reduce skepticism with regard to the accuracy of the results. Quality control tools could be used to build users' trust in automated approaches. In this paper, we present three plugins for visualization and quality control in large-scale multiplex tissue analysis of microscopy images. The first plugin focuses on the quality of cell staining, the second one was made for interactive evaluation and comparison of different cell classification results, and the third one serves for reviewing interactions of different cell types."

    "abstract": "Engineered living materials (ELMs) use encapsulated microorganisms within polymeric matrices for biosensing, drug delivery, capturing viruses, and bioremediation. It is often desirable to control their function remotely and in real time. Suitable, genetically engineered microorganisms respond to changes of their environment. Here, we combine this local sensitivity with a nanostructured encapsulation material to sensitize the ELM for infrared light. Previously, blue light has been used to stimulate microorganisms that contain optogenetic modules responsive to those wavelengths without the need for exogenous cofactors. Here, we use plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNR) that have a strong absorption maximum at 808 nm, a wavelength where human tissue is relatively transparent. Biocompatible composites of a Pluronic-based hydrogel and AuNR are prepared without agglomeration; they react to illumination by local heating. We measure a photothermal conversion efficiency of 47 % in transient temperature measurements. Steady-state temperature profiles from local photothermal heating are quantified using infrared photothermal imaging, correlated with measurements inside the gel, and applied to stimulate thermoresponsive bacteria. Using a bilayer ELM construct with the thermoresponsive bacteria and the thermoplasmonic composite gel in two separate but connected hydrogel layers, it is shown that the bacteria can be stimulated to produce a fluorescent protein using infrared light in a spatially controlled manner."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Rare variants (RVs) genetic association studies enable researchers to uncover the vari- ation in phenotypic traits left unexplained by common variation. Traditional single-variant analysis lacks power; thus, researchers have developed various methods to aggregate the effects of RVs across genomic regions to study their collective impact. Some existing methods utilize a static delineation of genomic regions, often resulting in suboptimal effect aggregation, as neutral subregions within the test region will result in an attenuation of signal. To pinpoint genomic regions enriched for disease-associated RVs, we developed a novel method, DYNATE (DYNamic Aggregation TEsting). DYNATE dynamically and hi- erarchically aggregates smaller genomic regions into larger ones and performs multiple testing for disease associations with controlled weighted false discovery rate. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of DYNATE under various scenarios compared to existing methods. Importantly, DYNATE-identified regions have higher enrichment levels of disease-associated RVs. We applied DYNATE to an amy- otrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study and identified a new gene, EPG5, harboringpossibly pathogenic mutations."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms located in long non-coding RNAs may result in the disruption of their secondary structure, affecting their function. Here, we functionally characterized the virus-induced type 1 diabetes-associated lncRNA ARGI (Antiviral Response Gene Inducer). ARGI upregulation in pancreatic beta cells leads to the transcriptional activation of antiviral and pro-inflammatory genes. Upon a viral insult, ARGI is upregulated in the nuclei of pancreatic beta cells and binds to CTCF to interact with the regulatory regions of IFNbeta and interferon-stimulated genes, promoting their transcriptional activation in an allele-specific manner. The presence of the risk allele for type 1 diabetes in ARGI induces an hyperactivation of type I IFN response in beta cells, an expression signature that is present in the pancreas of diabetic patients. These data shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which type 1 diabetes-related single nucleotide polymorphisms in long non-coding RNAs influence pathogenesis at the pancreatic beta cell level."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "The timing of the initial peopling of the Polynesian islands remains highly debated. Suggested dates are primarily based on archaeological evidence and differ by several hundred years. Ioannidis et al. [2021] used genome-wide data from 430 modern individuals from 21 Pacific islands to obtain genetic estimates. Their results supported late settlement dates, e.g. approximately 1200 CE for Rapa Nui. However, when investigating the underlying model we found that the genetic estimator used by Ioannidis et al. [2021] is biased to be about 300 years too old. Correcting for this bias gives genetic settlement dates that are more recent than any dates consistent with archaeological records, as radiocarbon dating of human-modified artifacts shows settlement definitively earlier than the bias-corrected genetic estimates. These too-recent estimates can only be explained by substantial gene flow between islands after their initial settlements. Therefore, contacts attested by archaeological and linguistic evidence must have been accompanied also by demographically significant movement of people. This gene flow well after the initial settlements was not modelled by Ioannidis et al. [2021] and challenges their interpretation that carving anthropomorphic stone statues was spread during initial settlements of islands. Instead, the distribution of this cultural practice likely reflects later inter-island exchanges, as suggested earlier."

    "abstract": "Background: The proteome of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) has not been systematically investigated. The aim of the present study was to reveal the proteome biology of dental implants affected with peri-implantitis. Methods: Patients with at least one diseased implant were included (probing depth 6 mm, 3 mm peri-implant radiological bone loss). Using sterile paper strips, samples were collected from healthy implants (I), healthy teeth (T) and peri-implantitis affected implants (P). Proteome analysis was performed using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data independent acquisition, allowing the identification and quantification of human and bacterial proteins as well as semi-specific peptides. Results: 38 samples from 13 patients were included in the study. 2332 different human proteins were identified across all samples. No differentially expressed proteins between T and I were found. Comparing P to I, 59 proteins were found upregulated and 31 downregulated in P with significance. Upregulated proteins included proinflammatory proteins such as immunoglobulins, dysferlin and S100P, as well as antimicrobial proteins, e.g. myeloperoxidase or azurocidin. Gene ontology analysis further revealed higher activity of immunological pathways. Proteolytic patterns indicated the activity of inflammatory proteins such as cathepsin G. 334 bacterial proteins were identified and quantified. Peri-implantitis showed elevated proteolytic activity. Conclusion: I and T share similarities in their proteome, while diseased implants deviate strongly from healthy conditions. The PICF proteome of peri-implantitis affected sites exhibits an inflammatory fingerprint, dominated by neutrophile activity when compared to healthy implants."

    "abstract": "Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) are two major regulators of cell growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coupling nutrient availability with resource-intensive anabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis. Even though TORC1 and PKA signaling converge on several shared targets, little is known on how these targets integrate signals from the two pathways. This is the case for Sfp1, a transcriptional activator of hundreds of ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis genes. To disentangle the roles of PKA and TORC1 in Sfp1 regulation, we constructed a large collection of Sfp1 (phospho)mutants, and studied their intracellular localization and phosphorylation. Besides the already known TORC1 phosphorylation sites, we discovered that Sfp1 contains two PKA sites and a functional Nuclear Export Signal (NES) which is regulated by TORC1 and PKA. We further showed that TORC1 and PKA regulate Sfp1 phosphorylation independently of each other, with loss of activity of either pathway being sufficient to relocalize the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal zinc fingers being necessary for the responsiveness of Sfp1 to TORC1 and PKA inputs. This work contributes to our understanding of how cells regulate their growth by monitoring the outputs of multiple growth-regulatory pathways."

    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation is vital for cell replication and in many bacteria is controlled by the ParABS system. A key part of this machinery is the association of ParB proteins to the parS-containing centromeric region to form the partition complex. Despite much work, the formation and structure of this nucleoprotein complex has remained unclear. However, it was recently discovered that CTP binding allows ParB dimers to entrap and slide along the DNA, as well as leading to more efficient condensation through ParB-mediated DNA bridging. Here, we use semi-flexible polymer simulations to show how these properties of sliding and bridging can explain partition complex formation. We find that transient ParB bridges can organise the DNA into either a globular state or into hairpins and helical structures, depending on the bridge lifetime. In separate stochastic simulations, we show that ParB sliding reproduces the experimentally measured multi-peaked binding profile of Caulobacter crescentus, indicating that bridging and other potential roadblocks are sufficiently short-lived that they do not hinder ParB spreading. Indeed, upon coupling the two simulation frameworks into a unified sliding and bridging model, we find that short-lived ParB bridges do not hinder ParB sliding and the model can reproduce both the ParB binding profile and the condensation of the nucleoprotein complex. Overall, our model clarifies the mechanism of partition complex formation and predicts its fine structure. We speculate that the DNA hairpins produced by ParB bridging underlie the secondary function of ParB to load the Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) complex onto the DNA."

    "abstract": "Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are plant proteins that form signaling circuits to transduce information through the plant cell membrane to the nucleus and activate processes that direct growth, development, stress response, and disease resistance. Upon sensing various environmental stress stimuli, RLKs interact with specific targets and recruits several other proteins to initiate the defense mechanism. Among many RLK subfamilies, leucine-rich repeat RLKs (LRR-RLKs) are the largest. Xa21, a member of LRR-RLK, is a vital receptor protein in rice plants that binds with bacterial RaxX21-sY, whereas OsSERK2 is a somatic embryogenic receptor kinase (SERK) acts as a coreceptor. This study focuses on the effect of a substitution mutation of aspartate128 with asparagine128 (D128N) in OsSERK2 on the interdependent binding pattern of the mentioned Xa21, RaxX21-sY, and OsSERK2 D128N proteins. The results showed that the D128N mutation in OsSERK2 can significantly change the interaction pattern of the critical residues of the OsSERK2 and affects its receptor-ligand (Xa21-RaxX21-sY) interaction in the complex."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-efficient method to identify new indications of approved or experimental drugs/compounds. It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still an unsolved issue in existing repurposing methods. As such, computational drug repurposing has not been widely adopted in clinical settings. In this work, based on a massive biomedical knowledge graph, we propose a computational drug repurposing framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs and diseases but also predicts the path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs) as their biomedical explanations. Specifically, we utilize the GraphSAGE model in an unsupervised manner to integrate each entity's neighborhood information and employ a Random Forest model to predict the treatment probabilities between pairs of drugs and diseases. Moreover, we train an adversarial actor-critic reinforcement learning model to predict the potential MOA for explaining drug purposing. To encourage the model to find biologically reasonable paths, we utilize the curated molecular interactions of drugs and a PubMed-publication-based concept distance to extract potential drug MOA paths from the knowledge graph as \"demonstration paths\" to guide the model during the process of path-finding. Comprehensive experiments and case studies show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive performance of drug repurposing and explanatory performance of recapitulating human-curated DrugMechDB-based paths."

    "abstract": "There is converging evidence that young blood conveys cells, vesicles and molecules able to revitalize function and restore organ integrity in old individuals. Here, we assessed the effects of young rat plasma on the lifespan, epigenetic age and healthspan of old female rats. Beginning at 25.3 months of age, a group of 9 rats (group T) was i.p injected with plasma from young rats (2 months) until their natural death. A group of control rats of the same age, received no treatment. Blood samples were collected every other week. Survival curves showed that from age 26 to 30 months, none of the T animals died, whereas the survival curve of C rats began to decline at age 26 months. The external appearance of the T rats was healthier than that of the C counterparts. Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) was assessed using the HorvathMammalMethylChip320. Blood DNAm age versus chronological age showed that DNAm age in young animals increased faster than chronological age then slowed down progressively, entering a plateau after 27 months. Immediately after the start of the treatment, the DNAm age (i.e., epigenetic age) of the treated rats fell below the DNAm age of controls and remained consistently lower until the end of their lives. Assessment of each experimental group showed that the blood DNA methylation levels of 1638 CpGs were different between treated and control blood samples (q-value<0.05). Of these, 1007 CpGs exhibited increased methylation, with age while 631 CpGs showed decreased methylation levels. When rats were grouped according to the similarities in their differential blood DNA methylation profile, samples from the treated and control rats clustered in separate groups. Analysis of promoter differential methylation in genes involved in systemic regulatory activities revealed specific GO term enrichment related to the insulin-like factors (IGFs) pathways as well as to cytokines and chemokines associated with immune and homeostatic functions. We conclude that young plasma therapy may constitute a natural noninvasive intervention for epigenetic rejuvenation and health enhancement, readily translatable to the clinic."

Convolutional Neural Networks, especially the U-Net-based architectures, are currently the state-of-the-art learning-based segmentation methods and have given unprecedented performances. However, their decision-making processes are still an active field of research. In order to reliably utilize such methods in healthcare, explainability of how the segmentation was performed is mandated. To date, explainability is studied and applied heavily in classification tasks. In this work, we propose the Chimeric U-Net, a U-Net architecture with an invertible decoder unit, that inherently brings explainability into semantic segmentation tasks. We find that having the restriction of an invertible decoder does not hinder the performance of the segmentation task. However, the invertible decoder helps to disentangle the class information in the latent space embedding and to construct meaningful saliency maps. Furthermore, we found that with a simple k-Nearest-Neighbours classifier, we could predict the Intersection over Union scores of unseen data, demonstrating that the latent space, constructed by the Chimeric U-Net, encodes an interpretable representation of the segmentation quality. Explainability is an emerging field, and in this work, we propose an alternative approach, that is, rather than building tools for explaining a generic architecture, we propose constraints on the architecture which induce explainability. With this approach, we could peer into the architecture to reveal its class correlations and local contextual dependencies, taking an insightful step towards trustworthy and reliable A.I."

Although multi-valent pneumococcal vaccines have curbed the incidence of disease, their introduction has resulted in shifted serotype distributions that must be monitored.

Although software exists to predict serotypes from WGS data, their use is constrained by the requirement of high-coverage Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) reads. This can present a challenge in so far as accessibility and data sharing.

PfaSTer combines dimensionality reduction from k-mer analysis with machine learning, allowing for rapid serotype prediction without the need for coverage-based assessments. We then demonstrate the robustness of this method, returning >97% concordance when compared to biochemical results and other in-silico serotypers.

However, studying spaceflight's effect on terrestrial life is difficult. NASA created GeneLab, a public Omics database for spaceflight-related data, to help combat these limitations. While GeneLab has very few DNA-based data sets, transcriptome information is abundant. This study used RNA-Seq data from GeneLab to examine DNA sequence variants linked to spaceflight stress exposure. More mutations were observed in spaceflight samples than in the ground control samples. This increase in variants was not reduced in samples grown under artificial gravity in space, suggesting that microgravity did not significantly affect the amount of DNA damage in this experiment. There was also an increase in transversion mutations, consistent with known forms of radiation-induced damage. This work demonstrates that RNA-Seq data is a useful resource for evaluating DNA damage from spaceflight and provides a baseline for the types of mutations that could be detected."

In this work, we define a conformational ensemble as an ordered set of probability distributions and provide a suitable metric to detect differences between two given ensembles at the residue level, both locally and globally. The underlying geometry of the conformational space is properly integrated, being one ensemble characterized by a set of probability distributions supported on the three-dimensional Euclidean space (for global-scale comparisons) and on the two-dimensional flat torus (for local-scale comparisons). The inherent uncertainty of the data is also taken into account to provide finer estimations of the differences between ensembles. Additionally, an overall distance between ensembles is defined from the differences at the residue level. We illustrate the interest of the approach with several examples of applications for the comparison of conformational ensembles: (i) produced from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using different force fields, and (ii) before and after refinement with experimental data. We also show the usefulness of the method to assess the convergence of MD simulations. The numerical tool has been implemented in Python through easy-to-use Jupyter Notebooks available at https://gitlab.laas.fr/moma/WASCO."

    "abstract": "The lymphatic system maintains bodily fluid balance by returning interstitial fluid to the venous system. Flow can occur through a combination of extrinsic pumping, due to forces from surrounding tissues, and intrinsic pumping involving contractions of muscle in the lymphatic vessel walls. Lymph transport is important not only for fluid homeostasis, but also for immune function, as lymph is a carrier for immune cells. Lymphatic muscle cells exhibit cardiac-like phasic contractions to generate flow and smooth-muscle-like tonic contractions to regulate flow. Lymphatic vessels therefore act as both active pumps and conduits. Lymphatic vessels are sensitive to mechanical stimuli, including flow-induced shear stresses and pressure-induced vessel stretch. These forces modulate biochemical pathways, leading to changes in intracellular calcium and interaction with regulatory and contractile proteins. In a multiscale computational model of phasic and tonic contractions in lymphatic muscle coupled to a lumped-parameter model of lymphatic pumping, we tested different models of the mechanical feedback mechanisms exhibited by lymphatics in experiments. Models were validated using flow and pressure experiments not used in the model construction. The final model shows that with flow-induced shear stress modulation, there is a small change in flow rate but an increase in muscle efficiency. A better understanding of the mechanobiology of lymphatic contractions can help guide future lymphatic vessel experiments, providing a basis for developing better treatments for lymphatic dysfunction."

    "abstract": "The toolbox for genome editing in basic research and therapeutic applications is rapidly expanding. While efficient targeted gene ablation using nuclease editors has been demonstrated from bench to bedside, precise transgene integration remains a technical challenge. AAV6 has been a prevalent donor carrier for homology-directed repair (HDR) mediated genome engineering but has reported safety issues, manufacturing constraints, and restricted applications due to its 4.5 Kb packaging limit. Non-viral targeted genetic knock-ins rely primarily on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and linear single-stranded DNA (lssDNA) donors. Both dsDNA and lssDNA have been previously demonstrated to have low efficiency and cytotoxicity. Here, we developed a non-viral genome writing catalyst (GATALYSTTM) system which allows production of ultrapure, minicircle single-stranded DNAs (cssDNAs) up to ~20 Kb as donor templates for highly efficient precision transgene integration. cssDNA donors enable knock-in efficiency of up to 70% in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), superior efficiency in multiple clinically relevant primary cell types, and at multiple genomic loci implicated for clinical applications with various nuclease editor systems. When applied to immune cell engineering, cssDNA engineered CAR-T cells exhibit more potent and durable anti-tumor efficacy than those engineered from AAV6 viral vectors. The exceptional precision and efficiency, improved safety, payload flexibility, and scalable manufacturability of cssDNA unlocks the full potential of genome engineering with broad applications in therapeutic development, disease modeling and other research areas."

Nevertheless, current NIGM techniques do not measure glucose in blood, but rely on indirect bulk measurement of glucose in the interstitial fluid, where glucose is less concentrated, diluted in a generally unknown volume, and appears in a delayed fashion relative to blood glucose, impairing NIGM accuracy. We introduce a new biosensor, termed Depth-gated mid-InfraRed Optoacoustic Sensor (DIROS), which offers for the first time non-invasive glucose detection directly in blood, while simultaneously rejecting contributions from the metabolically inactive stratum corneum and other superficial skin layers. This unique ability is achieved by time-gating mid-infrared optoacoustic signals to enable glucose readings from depth-selective localization in the microvasculature of the skin. In measurements of mice in vivo, DIROS revealed marked accuracy improvement over conventional bulk-tissue glucose measurements. We showcase how skin rejection and signal localization are essential for improving the NIGM accuracy, and discuss key results and how DIROS offers a holistic approach to address limitations of current NIGM methods, with high translation potential."

Applications of this phenomenon range from lab-on-a-chip to liquid lenses capable of altering their topology and focus within milliseconds. Electrowetting or EWOD theoretical models quantifying this effect fall into two paradigms: the Young-Lippman and the electromechanical theories. In this work, both paradigms were simulated to predict the velocity of a water droplet moving over an array of electrodes. Results were compared to experimental observations of measured velocities for two dielectric films: ETFE and household cling film. Theoretical model parameters, namely the length scale of the Maxwell force on the droplet, were also determined to align simulation and experiment. The results reveal the trend of droplet velocity in relation to applied voltage, and recapitulate the relationship between the two models."

M. brumae is not pathogenic and its in vitro phenotype and immunogenic properties have been well characterized. However, the knowledge of its underlying genetic composition is still incomplete. In this study, we first describe the 4 Mb genome of the M. brumae type strain ATCC 51384T assembling PacBio reads, and second, we assess the low intraspecies variability by comparing the type strain with Illumina reads from three additional strains. M. brumae genome is composed of a circular chromosome with a high GC content of 69.2 % and containing 3,791 CDSs, 97 pseudogenes, one prophage and no CRISPR loci. M. brumae has shown no pathogenic potential in in vivo experiments, and our genomic analysis confirms its phylogenetic position with other non-pathogenic and rapid growing mycobacteria. Accordingly, we determined the absence of virulence related genes, such as ESX-1 locus and most PE/PPE genes, among others. Although immunogenic potential of M. brumae was proved to be as high as Mycobacterium bovis BCG, the only mycobacteria licensed to treat cancer, the genomic content of M. tuberculosis T cell and B cell antigens in M. brumae is considerably lower than those of M. bovis BCG. Overall, this work provides relevant genomic data on one of the species of the mycobacterial genus with high therapeutic potential."

    "abstract": "Protein function is closely related to its structure and dynamics. Due to its large number of degrees of freedom, proteins adopt a large number of conformations, which describe a highly complex potential energy landscape. Considering the huge ensemble of conformations in dynamic equilibrium in solution, detailed investigation of proteins dynamics is extremely costly. Therefore, a significant number of different methods have emerged in order to improve the conformational sampling of biomolecules. One of these methods is Molecular Dynamics with excited Normal Modes (MDeNM) in which normal modes are used as collective variables in molecular dynamics. Here, we present a new implementation of the MDeNM method that allows a continuously controlled kinetic excitation energy in the normal mode space, while taking into account the natural constraints imposed either by the structure or the environment. These implementations prevent unphysical structural distortions. We tested the new approach on bacteriophage's T4 lysozyme, Gallus gallus hen egg-white lysozyme and Staphylococcus aureus membrane-bound transglycosylase. Our results showed that the new approach outperformed free MD sampling and preserved the structural features comparatively to the original MDeNM approach. We also observed that by adaptively changing the excitation direction during calculations, proteins follow new transition paths preventing structural distortions."

    "relevance": "2 Probably Irrelevant",
    "abstract": "In the current study, multiscale simulation approaches and dynamic network methods are employed to examine the dynamic and energetic details of conformational landscapes and allosteric interactions in the ABL kinase domain that determine the kinase functions. Using a plethora of synergistic computational approaches, we elucidate how conformational transitions between the active and inactive ABL states can employ allosteric regulatory switches to modulate the intramolecular communication networks between the ATP site, the substrate binding region, and the allosteric binding pocket. A perturbation-based network approach that implements mutational profiling of allosteric residue propensities and communications in the ABL states is proposed. Consistent with the biophysical experiments, the results reveal functionally significant shifts of the allosteric interaction networks in which preferential communication paths between the ATP binding site and substrate regions in the active ABL state become suppressed in the closed inactive ABL form, which in turn features favorable allosteric couplings between the ATP site and the allosteric binding pocket. By integrating the results of atomistic simulations with dimensionality reduction methods and Markov state models we analyze the mechanistic role of the macrostates and characterize kinetic transitions between the ABL conformational states. Using network-based mutational scanning of allosteric residue propensities, this study provides a comprehensive computational analysis of the long-range communications in the ABL kinase domain and identifies conserved regulatory hotspots that modulate kinase activity and allosteric cross-talk between the allosteric pocket, ATP binding site and substrate binding regions. The results of this study suggest that probing the intramolecular communication networks in the ABL conformations through targeted modifications of vulnerable network links may be useful for engineering and modulating kinase activities."

In this study, using a Potts protein sequence-covariation statistical energy model combined with Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations of evolutionary trajectories under drug selection pressure, we explore the evolution of drug resistance in HIV, starting from an ensemble of drug-naive patient protein sequences. We follow the time course of a total of more than fifty drug resistance mutations in Protease, Reverse Transcriptase, and Integrase. The KMC model on the fitness landscape accurately captures the relative acquisition times of drug-resistance mutations reported in the literature. We find primary drug-resistance mutations with long acquisition times typically require a larger number of accessory mutations to prime the sequence background for their acquisition and eventual entrenchment, while those with shorter acquisition times exhibit pre-existing high initial biases within the drug-naive patient population. We introduce a new metric, the potentiation factor in drug-naive patient protein sequences, that can be an accurate predictor of acquisition times for mutations subject to external selection pressures."

    "abstract": "Assessing the severity of new pathogenic variants requires an understanding of which mutations enable escape of the human immune response. Even single point mutations to an antigen can cause immune escape and infection by disrupting antibody binding. Recent work has modeled the effect of single point mutations on proteins by leveraging the information contained in large-scale, pretrained protein language models (PLMs). PLMs are often applied in a zero-shot setting, where the effect of each mutation is predicted based on the output of the language model with no additional training. However, this approach cannot appropriately model immune escape, which involves the interaction of two proteins--antibody and antigen--instead of one protein and requires making different predictions for the same antigenic mutation in response to different antibodies. Here, we explore several methods for predicting immune escape by building models on top of embeddings from PLMs. We evaluate our methods on a SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning dataset and show that our embedding-based methods significantly outperform zero-shot methods, which have almost no predictive power. We also highlight insights gained into how best to use embeddings from PLMs to predict escape. Despite these promising results, simple statistical and machine learning baseline models that do not use pretraining perform comparably, showing that computationally expensive pretraining approaches may not be beneficial for escape prediction. Furthermore, all models perform relatively poorly, indicating that future work is necessary to improve escape prediction with or without pretrained embeddings."

However, identifying the membrane regions and topology in three-dimensional structure files requires additional in silico prediction. Here, we introduce TMvisDB to sieve through millions of predicted structures for TMPs. This resource enables both, to browse through 46 million predicted TMPs and to visualize those along with their topological annotations. The database was created by joining AlphaFold DB structure predictions and transmembrane topology predictions from the protein language model based method TMbed.

    "abstract": "Obesity has been linked with numerous health issues as well as an increased risk of breast cancer. Although effects of direct obesity in patient outcomes is widely studied, effects of exposure to obesity-related systemic influences in utero has been overlooked. In this study, we investigated the effect of multigenerational obesity on epithelial cell migration and invasion using decellularized breast tissues explanted from normal female mouse pups from a diet induced multigenerational obesity mouse model. We first studied the effect of multigenerational diet on the mechanical properties, adipocyte size, and collagen structure of these mouse breast tissues, and then, examined the migration and invasion behavior of normal (KTB-21) and cancerous (MDA-MB-231) human mammary epithelial cells on the decellularized matrices from each diet group. Breast tissues of mice whose dams had been fed with high-fat diet exhibited larger adipocytes and thicker and curvier collagen fibers, but only slightly elevated elastic modulus and inflammatory cytokine levels. MDA-MB-231 cancer cell motility and invasion were significantly greater on the decellularized matrices from mice whose dams were fed with high-fat diet. A similar trend was observed with normal KTB-21 cells. Our results showed that the collagen curvature was the dominating factor on this enhanced motility and stretching the matrices to equalize the collagen fiber linearity of the matrices ameliorated the observed increase in cell migration and invasion in the mice that were exposed to a high-fat diet. Previous studies indicated an increase in serum leptin concentration for those children born to an obese mother. We generated extracellular matrices using primary fibroblasts exposed to various concentrations of leptin. This produced curvier ECM and increased breast cancer cell motility for cells seeded on the decellularized ECM generated with increasing leptin concentration. Our study shows that exposure to obesity in utero is influential in determining the extracellular matrix structure, and that the resultant changes in collagen curvature is a critical factor in regulating the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells."

This approach has been widely used for early-stage small-molecule drug design as well as identifying suitable protein-based macromolecule residues for mutagenesis. Estimating binding free energy, based on docking interactions of protein to its ligand based on an appropriate scoring function is often critical for protein mutagenesis studies to improve the activity or alter the specificity of targeted enzymes. However, calculating docking free energy for a large number of protein mutants is computationally challenging and time-consuming. Here, we showcase an end-to-end computational workflow for predicting the binding energy of pNP-Xylose substrate docked within the substrate binding site for a large library of combinatorial mutants of an alpha-L-fucosidase (TmAfc, PDB ID- 2ZWY) belonging to Thermotoga maritima glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 29. Briefly, in silico combinatorial mutagenesis was performed for the top conserved residues in TmAfc as determined by running multiple sequence alignment against all GH29 family enzyme sequences downloaded from an in-house developed Carbohydrate-Active enZyme (CAZy) database retriever program. The binding energy was calculated through Autodock Vina with pNP-Xylose ligand docking with energy minimized TmAfc mutants, and the data was then used to train a neural network model which was also validated for model predictions using data from Autodock Vina. The current workflow can be adopted for any family of CAZymes to rapidly identify the effect of different mutations within the active site on substrate binding free energy to identify suitable targets for mutagenesis. We anticipate that this workflow could also serve as the starting point for performing more sophisticated and computationally intensive binding free energy calculations to identify targets for mutagenesis and hence optimize use of wet lab resources."

Here, we present a convolutional neural network-based algorithm for fast upscaling of low-resolution or sparsely sampled images and combine it with a segmentation-less vectorization process for 3D reconstruction and statistical analysis of vascular network structure. In doing so, we also demonstrate that the use of semi-synthetic training data can replace the expensive and arduous process of acquiring low- and high-resolution training pairs without compromising vectorization outcomes, and thus open the possibility of utilizing such approaches for other MPM tasks where collecting training data is challenging. We applied our approach to large field of view images and show that our method generalizes across imaging depths, disease states and other differences in neurovasculature. Our pre-trained models and lightweight architecture can be used to reduce MPM imaging time by up to fourfold without any changes in underlying hardware, thereby enabling deployability across a range of settings."

    "abstract": "Tamoxifen-induced CreER-LoxP recombination is often used to induce spatiotemporally controlled gene deletion in genetically modified mice. Prior work has shown that tamoxifen and tamoxifen-induced CreER activation can have off-target effects that should be controlled. However, it has not yet been reported whether tamoxifen administration, independently of CreER expression, interacts adversely with commonly used anaesthetic drugs such as medetomidine or its enantiomer dexmedetomidine in mice. Here we report a high incidence of urinary plug formation linked to morbidity after ketamine-medetomidine anaesthesia in male mice previously injected with tamoxifen. As dexmedetomidine causes morbidity and mortality in male mice at higher rates than medetomidine, our findings suggest that both medetomidine and dexmedetomidine are both contra-indicated for male mice after tamoxifen treatment."

    "abstract": "The clinical course of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is variable and to a substantial degree still unpredictable, especially in persons who have neither been vaccinated nor recovered from previous infection. We hypothesized that disease progression and inflammatory responses were associated with alterations in the microbiome and metabolome. To test this, we integrated metagenome, metabolome, cytokine, and transcriptome profiles of longitudinally collected samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the beginning of the pandemic (before vaccines or variants of concern) and non-infected controls, and leveraged detailed clinical information and post-hoc confounder analysis to identify robust within- and cross-omics associations. Severe COVID-19 was directly associated with a depletion of potentially beneficial intestinal microbes mainly belonging to Clostridiales, whereas oropharyngeal microbiota disturbance appeared to be mainly driven by antibiotic use. COVID-19 severity was also associated with enhanced plasma concentrations of kynurenine, and reduced levels of various other tryptophan metabolites, lysophosphatidylcholines, and secondary bile acids. Decreased abundance of Clostridiales potentially mediated the observed reduction in 5-hydroxytryptophan levels. Moreover, altered plasma levels of various tryptophan metabolites and lower abundances of Clostridiales explained significant increases in the production of IL-6, IFN{gamma} and/or TNF. Collectively, our study identifies correlated microbiome and metabolome alterations as a potential contributor to inflammatory dysregulation in severe COVID-19."

    "abstract": "The freshwater polyp Hydra is a popular biological model system; however, we still do not understand one of its most salient behaviours, the generation of spontaneous body wall contractions. Here, by applying experimental fluid dynamics analysis and mathematical modelling, we provide functional evidence that spontaneous contractions of body walls enhance the transport of chemical compounds from and to the tissue surface where symbiotic bacteria reside. Experimentally, a reduction in the frequency of spontaneous body wall contractions is associated with a changed composition of the colonizing microbiota. Together, our findings suggest that spontaneous body wall contractions create an important fluid transport mechanism that (1) may shape and stabilize specific host-microbe associations and (2) create fluid microhabitats that may modulate the spatial distribution of the colonizing microbes. This mechanism may be more broadly applicable to animal-microbe interactions since research has shown that rhythmic spontaneous contractions in the gastrointestinal tracts are essential for maintaining normal microbiota."

Single molecule localization based super-resolution microscopy that requires high illumination intensities is currently limited to solid state photonic waveguide chips composed of hard-coated, high NA planar waveguides deposited on opaque substrates. These platforms do not permit epi-detection of fluorescence through the substrate, which limits the use of photonic waveguide chips to the upright configuration. Additionally, the detection efficiency is reduced because the majority of the fluorescence emission is directed towards the high refractive index substrate. A low cost waveguide chip based on a polymer core material deposited on common #1.5 coverslips that is easy to produce was recently demonstrated. Here, a platform that is capable of performing single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) of biological samples using polymer-based photonic waveguide chips is presented, enabling super-solution microscopy in the inverted microscope configuration. Super-resolved imaging of two different structures of the cytoskeleton in primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) by two popular SMLM methods, dSTORM and DNA-PAINT, down to 23 nm is demonstrated."

Computational approaches have become efficient solutions to infer annotations for unlabeled proteins by transferring knowledge from proteins with experimental annotations. Despite the increasing availability of protein structure data and the high coverage of high-quality predicted structures, e.g., by AlphaFold, many existing computational tools still only rely on sequence data to predict structural or functional annotations, including alignment algorithms such as BLAST and several sequence-based deep learning models. Here, we develop PenLight, a general deep learning framework for protein structural and functional annotations. PenLight uses a graph neural network (GNN) to integrate 3D protein structure data and protein language model representations. In addition, PenLight applies a contrastive learning strategy to train the GNN for learning protein representations that reflect similarities beyond sequence identity, such as semantic similarities in the function or structure space. We benchmarked PenLight on a structural classification task and a functional annotation task, where PenLight achieved higher prediction accuracy and coverage than state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Approaches to in silico prediction of protein structures have been revolutionized by AlphaFold2, while those to predict interfaces between proteins are relatively underdeveloped, owing to the overly complicated yet relatively limited data of protein--protein complexes. In short, proteins are 1D sequences of amino acids folding into 3D structures, and interact to form assemblies to function. We believe that such intricate scenarios are better modeled with additional indicative information that reflects their multi-modality nature and multi-scale functionality. To improve binary prediction of inter-protein residue-residue contacts, we propose to augment input features with multi-modal representations and to synergize the objective with auxiliary predictive tasks. (i) We first progressively add three protein modalities into models: protein sequences, sequences with evolutionary information, and structure-aware intra-protein residue contact maps. We observe that utilizing all data modalities delivers the best prediction precision}. Analysis reveals that evolutionary and structural information benefit predictions on the difficult and rigid protein complexes, respectively, assessed by the resemblance to native residue contacts in bound complex structures. (ii) We next introduce three auxiliary tasks via self-supervised pre-training (binary prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI)) and multi-task learning (prediction of inter-protein residue--residue distances and angles). Although PPI prediction is reported to benefit from predicting inter-contacts (as causal interpretations), it is not found vice versa in our study. Similarly, the finer-grained distance and angle predictions did not appear to uniformly improve contact prediction either. This again reflects the high complexity of protein--protein complex data, for which designing and incorporating synergistic auxiliary tasks remains challenging."

It has been shown that the use of synonymous codons is highly relevant in multiple biological processes including, among others, mRNA splicing, translational rates and protein folding. While the correlation between synonymous codons and secondary structure in translated proteins has been widely studied, Rosenberg et al. evaluated the effect of codon identity on a finer scale, analyzing whether the distribution of ({phi},{psi}) dihedral angles within secondary structure elements is significantly altered when synonymous codons are used. However, their statistical methodology is formally incorrect, casting doubt on the obtained results. The origin of the incorrectness is described in the following section. Then, using an appropriate methodology, we reanalyzed the data presented in (Rosenberg 2022). Our results confirm the influence of the codon on the distribution of the dihedral angles, but differ from those of Rosenberg et al. in the strength of significance of the differences depending on the secondary structure type. Finally, we assessed whether these findings may be affected by the structural classification or the local sequence context. These additional analyses show that codon-specific effects have similar significance in different areas of Ramachandran space, although the effect may be stronger for a particular type of secondary structure, such as {beta}-strands compared to -helices. They also indicate that synonymous codon effects are stronger when considered in the context of the local sequence."

    "abstract": "Discoveries from genome-wide association studies often contain large clusters of highly correlated genetic variants, which makes them hard to interpret. In such cases, finemapping the underlying causal variants become important. Here we present a new method, the Finemap-MiXeR, based on a variational Bayesian approach for finemapping genomic data, i.e., determining the causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a trait at a given locus after controlling for correlation among genetic variants due to linkage disequilibrium. Our approach is based on the optimization of Evidence Lower Bound of the likelihood function obtained from the MiXeR model. The optimization is done using Adaptive Moment Estimation Algorithm, allowing to obtain posterior probability of each SNP to be a causal variant. We tested Finemap-MiXeR in a range of different scenarios, using both synthetic and real data from the UK Biobank, using standing height phenotype as an example. In comparison to the FINEMAP and SuSiE methods, we observed that Finemap-MiXeR in most cases has better accuracy. Furthermore, it is computationally efficient, and unlike other methods the complexity is not increasing as the number of causal SNPs or the heritability increases. We show that our finemapping algorithm identifies a small number of genetic variants per locus which are informative for predicting the phenotype in an independent sample."

    "abstract": "The main function of articular cartilage is to provide a low friction surface and protect the underlying subchondral bone. The extracellular matrix composition of articular cartilage mainly consists of glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II. Specifically the collagen type II organization has a characteristic organization in three distinct zones; (1) the superficial zone which has collagen fibers oriented parallel to the surface, (2) the intermediate zone where there is no predominant orientation, and (3) the deep zone which shows a high orientation with fibers perpendicular to the underlying bone. Collagen type II fibers in these 3 zones take an arch-like organization that can be mimicked with segments of a hypotrochoidal curve. In this study, a script was developed that allowed the fabrication of scaffolds with a hypotrochoidal design. This design was investigated and compared to a regular 0-90 woodpile design. The results showed that the hypotrochoidal design was successfully fabricated. Micro-CT analyses divided the areas of the scaffold in their distinct zones. In addition, the mechanical analyses revealed that the hypotrochoidal design had a lower component Young's modulus while the toughness and strain at yield were higher compared to the woodpile design. Fatigue tests showed that the hypotrochoidal design lost more energy per cycle due to the damping effect of the unique microarchitecture . Finite element analyses revealed that the hypotrochoidal design had an improved stress distribution compared to the 0-90 woodpile design due to the lower component stiffness. In addition, data from cell culture under dynamic stimulation demonstrated that the collagen type II deposition was improved in the hypotrochoidal design. Finally, Alcian blue staining revealed that the areas where the stress was higher during the stimulation produced more glycosaminoglycans. Our results highlight a new and simple scaffold design based on hypotrochoidal curves that could be used for cartilage tissue engineering."

To characterize the advantages and drawbacks of different TRE attributes in facilitating cross-cohort analysis, we conducted a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of standard lipid measures on the UKB RAP and AoU RW using two approaches: meta-analysis and pooled analysis. We curated lipid measurements for 37,754 All of Us participants with whole genome sequence (WGS) data and 190,982 UK Biobank participants with whole exome sequence (WES) data. For the meta-analysis, we performed a GWAS of each cohort in their respective platform and meta-analyzed the results. We separately performed a pooled GWAS on both datasets combined. We identified 454 and 445 significant variants in meta-analysis and pooled analysis, respectively. Comparison of full summary data from both meta-analysis and pooled analysis with an external study showed strong correlation of known loci with lipid levels (R2~91-98%). Importantly, 84 variants met the significance threshold only in the meta-analysis and 75 variants were significant only in pooled analysis. These method-specific differences may be explained by differences in cohort size, ancestry, and phenotype distributions in All of Us and UK Biobank. Importantly, we noted a significant increase in the proportion of significant variants predominantly from non-European ancestry individuals in the pooled analysis compared to meta-analysis (p=0.01). Pooled analysis required about half as many computational steps as meta-analysis. These findings have important implications for both platform implementations and researchers undertaking large-scale cross-cohort analyses, as technical and policy choices lead to cross-cohort analyses generating similar, but not identical results, particularly for non-European ancestral populations."

We demonstrate that MOCAT sufficiently delipidates whole mouse brain and human brain blocks and is superior to 10% formalin for long-term antigenicity preservation; moreover, the spatial information of biomarkers offered by MOCAT-processed intact mouse brains is identical to that offered by freshly prepared SDS-delipidated intact mouse brains.

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA (aDNA) can prove a valuable resource when investigating the evolutionary relationships between ancient and modern populations. Performing demographic inference using datasets that include aDNA samples however, requires statistical methods that explicitly account for the differences in drift expected among a temporally distributed sample. Such drift due to temporal structure can be challenging to discriminate from admixture from an unsampled, or \"ghost\", population, which can give rise to very similar summary statistics and confound methods commonly used in population genetics. Sequence data from ancient individuals also have unique characteristics, including short fragments, increased sequencing-error rates, and often limited genome-coverage that poses further challenges. Here we present a novel and conceptually simple approach for assessing questions of population continuity among a temporally distributed sample. We note that conditional on heterozygote sites in an individual genome at a particular point in time, the mean proportion of derived variants at those sites in other individuals has different expectations forwards in time and backwards in time. The difference in these processes enables us to construct a statistic that can detect population continuity in a temporal sample of genomes. We can show that the statistic is sensitive to historical admixture events from unsampled populations. Simulations are used to evaluate the power of this approach. We investigate a set of ancient genomes from Early Neolithic Scandinavia to assess levels of population continuity to an earlier Mesolithic individual. Individuals from hunter-gathering Neolithic Pitted Ware culture show marked continuity with the Mesolithic individual, whereas the contemporary Neolithic individuals from the and farming Funnel Beaker culture display much less continuity."

    "abstract": "The cranial vault - the portion of the skull surrounding the brain and cerebellum - is highly variable, clinically relevant, and heritable, yet its genetic architecture remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a joint multi-ancestry and admixed multivariate GWAS on 3D cranial vault shape extracted from magnetic resonance images of 6,772 children from the ABCD study cohort, identifying 30 genome-wide significant genetic loci and replicating 20 of these signals in 16,947 additional individuals of the UK Biobank. This joint multi-ancestry GWAS was enriched for genetic components of cranial vault shape shared across ancestral groups and yielded a greater discovery than a European-only GWAS. We present supporting evidence for parietal versus frontal bone localization for several of the identified genes based on expression patterns in E15.5 mice. Collectively, our GWAS loci were enriched for processes related to skeletal development and showed elevated activity in cranial neural crest cells, suggesting a role during early craniofacial development. Among the identified genes, were RUNX2 and several of its upstream and downstream actors, highlighting the prominent role of intramembranous ossification - which takes place at the cranial sutures - in influencing cranial vault shape. We found that mutations in many genes associated with craniosynostosis exert their pathogenicity by modulating the same pathways involved in normal cranial vault development. This was further demonstrated in a non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis case-parent trio dataset of 63 probands (n = 189), where our GWAS signals near BMP2, BBS9, and ZIC2 contributed significantly to disease risk. Moreover, we found strong evidence of overlap with genes influencing the morphology of the face and the brain, suggesting a common genetic architecture connecting these developmentally adjacent structures. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the genetics underlying normal cranial vault shape and its relevance for understanding modern human craniofacial diversity and the etiology of congenital malformations."

    "abstract": "Meiosis is associated with genetic changes in the genome - via recombination, gene conversion, and mutations. The occurrence of gene conversion and mutations during meiosis may further be influenced by the chromatin conformation, in analogy to what is known for mutations during mitosis. To date, however, the exact distribution and type of meiosis-associated changes and the role of the chromatin conformation in this context is largely unexplored. Here, we determine recombination, gene conversion, and de novo mutations using whole-genome sequencing of all meiotic products of 23 individual meioses in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important pathogen of wheat. We could confirm a high genome-wide recombination rate of 65 cM/Mb and see higher recombination rates on the accessory compared to core chromosomes. A substantial fraction of 0.16% of all polymorphic markers was affected by gene conversions, showing a weak GC-bias, and occurring at higher frequency in regions of constitutive heterochromatin, indicated by the histone modification H3K9me3. The de novo mutation rate associated with meiosis was approx. three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding mitotic mutation rate. Importantly, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences, is active in Z. tritici and responsible for the majority of these de novo meiotic mutations. Our results indicate that the genetic changes associated with meiosis are a major source of variability in the genome of an important plant pathogen and shape its evolutionary trajectory.\n\nImportanceThe impact of meiosis on the genome composition via gene conversion and mutations is mostly poorly understood, in particular for non-model species. Here, we sequenced all four meiotic products for 23 individual meioses and determined the genetic changes caused by meiosis for the important fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We found a high rate of gene conversions and an effect of the chromatin conformation on gene conversion rates. Higher conversion rates were found in regions enriched with the H3K9me3 - a mark for constitutive heterochromatin. Most importantly, meiosis was associated with a much higher frequency of de novo mutations than mitosis. 78% of the meiotic mutations were caused by repeat-induced point mutations - a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences. In conclusion, the genetic changes associated with meiosis are therefore a major factor shaping the genome of this fungal pathogen."

    "date": "2022-12-01",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Tuning of genome structure and function is accomplished by chromatin binding proteins, which determine the transcriptome and phenotype of the cell. We sought to investigate how communication between extracellular stress and chromatin structure may regulate cellular mechanical behaviors. We demonstrate that the linker histone H1.0, which compacts nucleosomes into higher order chromatin fibers, controls genome organization and cellular stress response. Histone H1.0 has privileged expression in fibroblasts across tissue types in mice and humans, and modulation of its expression is necessary and sufficient to mount a myofibroblast phenotype in these cells. Depletion of histone H1.0 prevents transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta})-induced fibroblast contraction, proliferation and migration in a histone H1 isoform-specific manner via inhibition of a transcriptome comprised of extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal and contractile genes. Histone H1.0 is associated with local regulation of gene expression via mechanisms involving chromatin fiber compaction and reprogramming of histone acetylation, rendering the cell stiffer in response to cytokine stimulation. Knockdown of histone H1.0 prevented locus-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation by TGF-{beta} and decreased levels of both HDAC1 and the chromatin reader BRD4, thereby preventing transcription of a fibrotic gene program. Transient depletion of histone H1.0 in vivo decompacts chromatin and prevents fibrosis in cardiac muscle, thereby linking chromatin structure with fibroblast phenotype in response to extracellular stress. Our work identifies an unexpected role of linker histones to orchestrate cellular mechanical behaviors, directly coupling cellular force generation, nuclear organization and gene transcription.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518399v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (103K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a061forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@47f605org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68f6b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11deade_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal diseases are a leading and untreatable cause of blindness and are therefore candidate diseases for gene therapy. Recombinant vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (rAAV) are currently the most promising vehicles for in vivo therapeutic gene delivery to the retina. However, there is a need for novel AAV-based vectors with greater efficacy for ophthalmic applications, as underscored by recent reports of dose-related inflammatory responses in clinical trials of rAAV-based ocular gene therapies. Improved therapeutic efficacy of vectors would allow for decreases in the dose delivered, with consequent reductions in immune reactions. Here, we describe the development of new rAAV vectors using bioconjugation chemistry to modify the rAAV capsid, thereby improving the therapeutic index. Covalent coupling of a mannose ligand, via the formation of a thiourea bond, to the amino groups of the rAAV capsid significantly increases vector transduction efficiency of both rat and nonhuman primate retinas. These optimized rAAV vectors have important implications for the treatment of a wide range of retinal diseases."

Here, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium presents the complete 62,460,029 base pair sequence of a human Y chromosome from the HG002 genome (T2T-Y) that corrects multiple errors in GRCh38-Y and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence to the reference, revealing the complete ampliconic structures of TSPY, DAZ, and RBMY; 42 additional protein-coding genes, mostly from the TSPY gene family; and an alternating pattern of human satellite 1 and 3 blocks in the heterochromatic Yq12 region. We have combined T2T-Y with a prior assembly of the CHM13 genome and mapped available population variation, clinical variants, and functional genomics data to produce a complete and comprehensive reference sequence for all 24 human chromosomes."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has led to its incomplete assembly and systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here, we present long-read de novo assemblies of 43 diverse Y-chromosomes, three contiguously assembled including two from deep-rooted African Y lineages. Examination of the full extent of genetic variation between Y chromosomes across 180,000 years of human evolution reveals its remarkable complexity and diversity in size and structure, in contrast with its low level of base substitution variation. The size of the Y chromosome assemblies vary extensively from 45.2 to 84.9 Mbp, with individual repeat arrays showing up to 6.7-fold difference in length across samples. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large (up to 5.94 Mbp) inversions with a >2-fold higher recurrence rate compared to the rest of the human genome. The Y centromere, composed of 171 bp -satellite monomer units, appears to have evolved from tandem arrays of a 36-mer ancestral higher order repeat (HOR), which has been predominantly replaced by a 34-mer HOR, and reveals a pattern of higher sequence variation towards the short-arm side. The Yq12 heterochromatic region is ubiquitously flanked by approximately 649 kbp and 472 kbp inversions that maintain the alternating arrays of DYZ1 and DYZ2 repeat units in between. While the sizes and the distribution of the DYZ1 and DYZ2 arrays vary considerably, primarily due to local expansions and contractions, the copy number ratio between the DYZ1 and DYZ2 monomer repeat units remains consistently close to 1:1. In addition, we have identified on average 65 kbp of novel sequence per Y chromosome. The availability of sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple samples provides a basis for identifying new associations of specific traits with the Y chromosome and garnering novel evolutionary insights."

Due to limited transcriptomic and methylomic information for facultative hibernators, we here conducted RNA and whole genome bisulfite sequencing in liver of hibernating Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Gene Ontology analysis was performed on 844 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and confirmed the shift in metabolic fuel utilization, inhibition of RNA transcription and cell cycle regulation as found in seasonal hibernators. We show a so far unreported suppression of MAPK and PP1 pathways. Notably, hibernating hamsters showed upregulation of MAPK inhibitors (DUSPs and SPRYs) and reduced levels of MAPK induced transcription factors. Promoter methylation was found to modulate the expression of genes targeted by these transcription factors. In conclusion, we document gene regulation between hibernation phases, which may aid the identification of pathways and targets to prevent organ damage in transplantation or ischemia-reperfusion."

    "abstract": "Human height is strongly influenced by genetics but the contribution of modifiable epigenetic factors is under-explored, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). We investigated links between blood DNA methylation and child height in four LMIC cohorts (n=1927) and identified a robust association at three CpGs in the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) gene which replicated in a high-income country cohort (n=879). SOCS3 methylation (SOCS3m) - height associations were independent of genetic effects. Mendelian randomization analysis confirmed a causal effect of SOCS3m on height. In longitudinal analysis in a LMIC cohort, SOCS3m explained a maximum 9.5% of height variance in mid-childhood while the variance explained by height polygenic risk score increased from birth to 21 years (2% to 18%). Childrens SOCS3m was associated with prenatal maternal folate and socio-economic status. In-vitro characterization confirmed a regulatory effect of SOCS3m on gene expression. Our findings suggest that epigenetic modifications may play an important role in driving child height in LMIC."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "The motility of macrophages in response to microenvironment stimuli is a hallmark of innate immunity, where macrophages play pro-inflammatory or pro-reparatory roles depending on their activation status during wound healing. Cell size and shape have been informative in defining macrophage subtypes, but their link to motility properties is unknown, despite M1 and M2 macrophages exhibiting distinct migratory behaviors, in vitro, in 3D and in vivo. We apply both morphology and motility-based image processing approaches to analyze live cell images consisting of macrophage phenotypes. Macrophage subtypes are differentiated from primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages using a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). We show that morphology is tightly linked to motility, which leads to our hypothesis that motility analysis could be used alone or in conjunction with morphological features for improved prediction of macrophage subtypes. We train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict macrophage subtypes based on morphology alone, motility alone, and both morphology and motility combined. We show that motility has comparable predictive capabilities as morphology. However, using both measures can enhance predictive capabilities. While motility and morphological features can be individually ambiguous identifiers, together they provide significantly improved prediction accuracies (>79%) using only phase contrast time-lapse microscopy and a small unique cell count for training ([~]250). Thus, the approach combining cell motility and cell morphology information can accurately assess functionally diverse macrophage phenotypes quickly and efficiently. Our approach offers a cost efficient and high through-put method for screening biochemicals targeting macrophage polarization with small datasets.\n\nSignificancePrevious work has shown that macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their morphological characteristics. We extend this work to show that distinct motility patterns are linked to macrophage morphology. Thus, motility patterns can be used to differentiate phenotypes. This can enable high-throughput classification of cell phenotypes without regard for the high-resolution images needed to back out morphological characteristics. Furthermore, combining motility-based features with morphological information improves prediction of macrophage subtypes by a machine learning based classification model."

    "abstract": "Regulated cellular aggregation is an essential process for development and healing in many animal tissues. In some animals and a few distantly related unicellular species, cellular aggregation is regulated by diffusible chemical cues. However, it is unclear whether regulated cellular aggregation was part of the life cycles of the first multicellular animals and/or their unicellular ancestors. To fill this gap, we investigated the triggers of cellular aggregation in one of animals closest unicellular living relatives - the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki. We discovered that Capsaspora aggregation is induced by chemical cues, as observed in some of the earliest branching animals and other unicellular species. Specifically, we found that calcium ions and lipids present in lipoproteins function together to induce aggregation of viable Capsaspora cells. We also found that this multicellular stage is reversible, as depletion of the cues triggers disaggregation, which can be overcome upon re-induction. Our finding demonstrates that chemically regulated aggregation is important across diverse members of the holozoan clade. Therefore, this phenotype was plausibly integral to the life cycles of the unicellular ancestors of animals."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Changes in DNA methylation with age are observed across the tree of life. The stereotypical nature of these changes can be modeled to produce epigenetic clocks capable of predicting biological age with unprecedented accuracy. Despite the predictive ability of epigenetic clocks, the underlying processes that produce clock signals are not resolved but are hypothesized to be rooted in stochastic processes leading to an erosion in the epigenetic landscape. Here, we test this hypothesis using a novel computational approach for measuring disorder in DNA methylation patterns across the epigenome. We find that loci comprising conventional epigenetic clocks are enriched in regions that both accumulate and lose disorder with age, suggesting a direct link between DNA methylation disorder and epigenetic clock signals. Across the murine lifespan, disorder accumulates in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes and decreases in CTCF and transcription factor binding sites, resulting in genomic hotspots of age-related epigenetic disorder. We further investigate the connections between age-related changes in disorder and epigenetic clock signals by comparing the influences of development, lifespan interventions, and cellular dedifferentiation using a series of newly developed epigenetic clocks based on regional disorder, average methylation states, and commonly used measures of entropy. We identify both common responses as well as critical differences between canonical epigenetic clocks and those based on regional disorder, demonstrating a fundamental decoupling of epigenetic aging processes. Collectively, this work identifies key linkages between epigenetic disorder and epigenetic clock signals, and simultaneously demonstrates the multifaceted nature of epigenetic aging in which stochastic processes occurring at non-random loci produce predictable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have improved contiguity of de novo genome assemblies. Nevertheless, the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms which are polyploid remain unfinished, limiting understanding of genetic and structural variation in diploid or polyploid organisms. Herein, we report the methodology and analysis of a 100% complete, gapless, phased, telomere-to-telomere diploid genome assembly of the eukaryote, Scenedesmus obliquus UTEX 3031 (DOE0152Z). Analysis of the fully assembled and resolved haplotypes revealed significant genomic rearrangements. Inter-haplotype heterogeneity was significant on most chromosomes yet one chromosome pair (Chromosome 15) was found to contain nearly no heterozygosity. Analysis of the 5mC methylation patterns revealed divergence in active gene content across haplotypes. Assembly of fully resolved chromosome pairs enabled complete resolution of genomic rearrangements and heterogeneity of haplotypes, the genomic basis of trait gain/loss, and evolutionary divergence across chromosome pairs. Further, when combined with 5mC methylation patterns, the assembly provides critical annotation information for genetic engineering approaches to achieve full knock-outs in allelic pairs."

    "abstract": "Stochastic differences among clonal cells can initiate cell fate decisions in development or cause cell-to-cell differences in the responses to drugs or extracellular ligands. We hypothesize that some of this phenotypic variability is caused by stochastic fluctuations in the activities of transcription factors. We tested this hypothesis in NIH3T3-CG cells using the response to Hedgehog signaling as a model cellular response. Here we present evidence for the existence of distinct fast and slow responding substates of NIH3T3-CG cells. These two substates have distinct expression profiles, and fluctuations in the activity of the Prrx1 transcription factor (TF) underlie some of the differences in expression and responsiveness between fast and slow cells. We speculate that similar variability in other TFs may underlie other phenotypic differences among genetically identical cells."

However, the variety of products and the complexity of import/export routes make trade monitoring challenging. We investigate the use of a portable, universal, DNA-based tool which would greatly facilitate in-situ monitoring. We collected shark and ray samples across the Island of Java, Indonesia, and selected 28 species (including 22 CITES-listed species) commonly encountered in landing sites and export hubs to test a recently developed real-time PCR single-assay originally developed for screening bony fish. We employed a deep learning algorithm to recognize species based on DNA melt-curve signatures. By combining visual and machine learning assignment methods, we distinguished 25 out of 28 species, 20 of which were CITES-listed. With further refinement, this method can provide a practical tool for monitoring elasmobranch trade worldwide, without the need for a lab or the bespoke design of species-specific assays.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe applied a portable, universal, closed-tube DNA barcoding approach originally developed for bony fishes to distinguish between shark and ray species traded in Indonesia.\nC_LIO_LIWe built a deep machine learning model to automatically assign species from the qPCR fluorescence spectra produced by two barcodes\nC_LIO_LIThe model achieved 79.41% accuracy for classifying 28 elasmobranch species, despite the barcode regions being designed for teleost species\nC_LIO_LIThis tool can serve as a potent single-assay in-situ diagnostic tool to regulate trade operations and it will be significantly enhanced by further optimisation of the barcode regions to fit elasmobranch DNA sequence variation\nC_LI"

Biophysical similarities lead to mistargeting of mitochondrial TAs to the ER, where they are delivered to the ER membrane protein complex (EMC). We showed that the EMC directly contributes to sorting fidelity of mitochondrial TAs and multipass substrates that contain positively charged soluble domains. Leveraging an improved structural model of the human EMC, we used mutagenesis and site-specific crosslinking to map the path of a TA from its cytosolic capture by methionine-rich loops to its membrane insertion through a hydrophilic vestibule. Positively charged residues at the entrance to the vestibule function as a selectivity filter that uses charge-repulsion to reject mitochondrial TAs. Substrate discrimination by the EMC provides a biochemical explanation for one role of charge in TA sorting and protects compartment identity by limiting protein misinsertion."

    "date": "2022-12-01",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Accurate timing of division and size homeostasis is crucial for cells. A potential mechanism for cells to decide the timing of division is the differential scaling of regulatory protein copy numbers with cell size. However, it remains unclear whether such a mechanism can lead to robust growth and division, and how the scaling behaviors of regulatory proteins affect the cell size distribution. In this study, we formulate a mathematical model combining gene expression and cell growth, in which the cell-cycle inhibitors scale sublinearly with cell size while the activators scale superlinearly. The cell divides once the ratio of their concentrations reaches a threshold value. We find that the cell can robustly grow and divide within a finite range of the threshold value. Intriguingly, the cell size at birth is proportional to the ploidy, in agreement with experiments. In a stochastic version of the model, the cell size at division is uncorrelated with that at birth. Also, the more differential the cell-size scaling of the cell-cycle regulators is, the narrower the cell-size distribution is. Finally, after the deletion of a regulator, the average cell size can change significantly while the coefficient of variation of cell size remains roughly the same, consistent with experimental observations.\n\nAuthor summaryHow cells determine the timing of cell division is a fundamental question of cell biology. It has been found that the concentration of cell-cycle activators tends to increase with cell size, while the concentration of inhibitors tends to decrease. Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that the ratio of activators to inhibitors may trigger cell division. To investigate this hypothesis quantitatively, we formulate a model including gene expression and cell growth simultaneously. The cell divides once the activator-to-inhibitor ratio reaches a threshold. Combining theories and simulations, we analyze the conditions of robust cell cycle and the cell size distribution. Our model successfully rationalizes several experimental observations, including the relation between cell size and ploidy, the sizer behavior of cell size control, and the change of the mean and fluctuation of cell size distribution after regulator deletion."

Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this disease is a prerequisite to identify potential pharmacological treatment strategies. In this study, we present a unique aortic valve cell isolation technique to acquire specific human and porcine cell populations and compared VICs and VECs of these species with each other for the first time.\n\nMethods and ResultsAortic valve cells were isolated from human explants from patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement or porcine valvular tissue. Pure VEC and VIC populations could be verified by gene expression analysis and immunofluorescence staining showing a highly significant upregulation of endothelial markers in VECs and mesenchymal markers in VICs, respectively. Further analysis and comparison of cells in in vitro experiments revealed that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition could be induced in hVECs, leading to significant increase of mesenchymal markers. In vitro calcification experiments of VICs induced by osteogenic medium or pro-calcifying medium demonstrated a pronounced calcification marker expression and visible calcific deposition in Alizarin red staining in both species.\n\nConclusionThis study aims to initiate a first step towards standardization of a reproducible isolation technique for pure human and porcine VEC and VIC populations. Comparison of human and porcine aortic valve cells demonstrated that porcine cells might serve as an alternative cellular model system, in settings, where human tissues are difficult to obtain.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsThe authors declare no relevant financial or non-financial interests to disclose."

    "abstract": "The nucleus is a mechanically stable compartment of the cell that contains the genome and performs many essential functions. Nuclear mechanical components chromatin and lamins maintain nuclear shape, compartmentalization, and function by resisting antagonistic actin contraction and confinement. However, studies have yet to compare chromatin and lamins perturbations side-by-side as well as modulated actin contraction while holding confinement constant. To accomplish this, we used NLS-GFP to measure nuclear shape and rupture in live cells with chromatin decompaction (VPA), loss of lamin B1 (LMNB1-/-), and loss of lamin A/C (LMNA-/-). We then modulated actin contraction while maintaining actin confinement measured by nuclear height. Wild type, chromatin decompaction, and lamin B1 null present bleb-based nuclear deformations and ruptures dependent on actin contraction and independent of actin confinement. Inhibition of actin contraction by Y27632 decreased nuclear blebbing and ruptures to near 0% of cells while activation of actin contraction by CN03 increased the frequency of ruptures by nearly two-fold. However, lamin A/C null results in overall abnormal shape, but similar blebs and ruptures as wild type which were unaffected by actin contraction modulation. Actin contraction control of nuclear shape and ruptures showed that DNA damage levels were more correlated with perturbed nuclear shape than they were with changes in nuclear ruptures. We reveal that lamin B1 is a chromatin decompaction phenotype because using GSK126, which mimics the loss of facultative heterochromatin in lamin B1 null, is sufficient to phenocopy increased nuclear blebbing and ruptures. Furthermore, even though blebs and ruptures in lamin A/C null cells are insensitive to actin contraction, they do have the capacity to form increased levels of nuclear blebs and bleb-based ruptures, shown by treating with VPA. Thus, nuclear bleb formation and bleb-based nuclear ruptures are driven by actin contraction and independent of changes in actin confinement."

Knowledge about protein localization in Golgi compartments is largely based on work in cell lines.

We localized these proteins by measuring the distance relative to the canonical TGN marker TGN38. Based on this, proteins fell into three groups: upstream of, overlapping with or downstream of TGN38. Seven proteins showed complete overlap with TGN38, while proteins downstream of TGN38 were located at varying distances from TGN38. Proteins upstream of TGN38 were localized in between TGN38 and the cis-/medial Golgi markers Giantin and GM130. This localization was consistent with protein function. Our data provide an overview of the relative localization of endogenous proteins in the Golgi of primary mouse neurons."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulatory molecules in a number of cell types, but neither the identity nor the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in crMPs are known. Here, we have employed deep RNA-seq and single cell RNA sequencing to resolve the crMP lncRNA landscape from healthy and diseased murine myocardium. CrMPs express previously unknown and highly cell type-specific lncRNAs, among which one lncRNA, termed Schlafenlnc, was particularly abundant and enriched in crMPs. We found Schlafenlnc to be necessary for migration-associated gene expression in macrophages in vitro and in vivo and essential for their adhesion and migration. Collectively, our data provide a basis to the systematic characterization of lncRNAs in crMPs and establish Schlafenlnc as a critical regulator of macrophage migratory functions."

    "abstract": "Protein import into mitochondria is an intricate and highly conserved process essential for organellar biogenesis, and maintenance of its structure and function. Defects in the import apparatus impact the assembly of the respiratory chain and ATP synthase complexes required for oxidative phosphorylation, compromising the ready supply of ATP to the cell. The consequences of reduced bioenergetic function are particularly severe for cells with high energetic demands such as neurons. However, relatively little is known about how defective import contributes to neurodegeneration, or how neurotoxic proteins characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases impact mitochondrial import efficiency. Here, we used HeLa cells to investigate how expressing high levels of Tau variants affect mitochondrial import activity, morphology, and function. We found that the variant associated with neurodegeneration (TauP301L) colocalises with mitochondria. TauP301L, but not wildtype Tau, interacts with TOM40, the protein-channel component of the outer membrane protein import complex. Interestingly, TauP301L expression had no discernible effect on overall mitochondrial import function, despite associating with TOM40 and altering mitochondrial morphology, suggesting that a rescue mechanism is at play. This rescue could be explained by the appearance of microtubule and actin containing tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), used to recruit healthy mitochondria from neighbouring cells and/or dispose of mitochondria with aggregated Tau. Furthermore, in primary neuronal cultures TauP301L induces morphological changes that resemble a neurodegeneration like phenotype, and this is mirrored in cells where the import sites are blocked artificially. These results reveal an intriguing link between the production of aggregation prone protein variants, such as Tau, and the mitochondrial protein import machinery relevant to neurodegenerative disease."

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a highly lethal disease with progressive dilatation of the abdominal aorta accompanied by degradation and remodelling of the vessel wall due to chronic inflammation. Platelets are small anuclear cells that can release various inflammatory cytokines and biological response modulators when activated. In cardiovascular diseases, platelets are crucial for the inflammatory response but their role in AAA is poorly understood. However, both -experimental and clinical data-strongly suggest that platelet activation may be relevant for AAA formation and progression. Here, we find that platelets play a crucial role in promoting AAA through modulation of inflammation and degradation of the ECM. They are responsible for the up-regulation of SPP1 (osteopontin, OPN) gene expression in macrophages and aortic tissue, which triggers inflammation and remodeling. Further, enhanced platelet activation and pro-coagulant activity results in elevated gene expression of various cytokines, Mmp9 and Col1a1 in macrophages. Platelet depletion in experimental murine AAA reduced inflammation and ECM remodeling, with reduced elastin fragmentation and aortic diameter expansion. In conclusion, our data strongly supports the potential relevance of anti-platelet therapy to reduce AAA progression and rupture in AAA patients."

By combining kinetic and binding assays with single actin filament observations in TIRF microscopy, we show that the association of talin and vinculin mutants, mimicking different degrees of activation, results in a variety of activities. In particular, mechanically stretched talin and activated vinculin combine to stimulate actin assembly synergistically through a sequential mechanism in which filaments are nucleated, capped and released to elongate. Our findings suggest a versatile mechanism for the regulation of actin assembly in FAs subjected to various combinations of biochemical and mechanical cues."

The peptides tested are variants of an evolved AMP called D-CONGA, which has excellent antimicrobial activities in vitro and in vivo. In this generation of rational D-CONGA variants, we tested multiple sequence-function hypotheses that had not been tested in previous generations. Many of the peptide variants tested have lower antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially those that have altered hydrophobicity, secondary structure potential, or spatial distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues. Thus, D-CONGA is generally well tuned for good antimicrobial activity. However, we identified one variant, D-CONGA-Q7, with a polar glutamine inserted into the middle of the sequence, that has higher activity against both planktonic and biofilm-forming bacteria and lower cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts. Against clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae, innate resistance to D-CONGA was surprisingly common despite a lack of inducible resistance in P. aeruginosa reported in our previous work. Yet, these same isolates are susceptible to D-CONGA-Q7. Additional mechanistic work will be required to understand why D-CONGA-Q7 is less prone to innate resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. In the spirit of synthetic molecular evolution, the discovery of D-CONGA-Q7 achieved a critical gain-of-function, and has provided a significantly better template sequence for the next generation of synthetic evolution."

    "abstract": "Insulators are cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) that can block enhancers from activating target promoters or act as barriers to block the spread of heterochromatin. Their name derives from their ability to  insulate transgenes from genomic position effects, an important function in gene therapy and biotechnology applications that require high levels of sustained transgene expression. In theory, flanking transgenes with insulators protects them from position effects, but in practice, efforts to insulate transgenes meet with mixed success because the contextual requirements for insulator function in the genome are not well understood. A key question is whether insulators are modular elements that can function anywhere in the genome or whether they are adapted to function only in certain genomic locations. To distinguish between these two possibilities we developed MPIRE (Massively Parallel Integrated Regulatory Elements) and used it to measure the effects of three insulators (A2, cHS4, ALOXE3) and their mutants at thousands of locations across the genome. Our results show that each insulator functions in only a small number of genomic locations, and that insulator function depends on the sequence motifs that comprise each insulator. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but specificity arises because each insulator blocks enhancers that are bound by different sets of transcription factors. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but only ALOXE3 can act as a heterochromatin barrier. We conclude that insulator function is highly context dependent and that MPIRE is a robust and systematic method for revealing the context dependencies of insulators and other cis-regulatory elements across the genome."

They influence cell shape and Hippo signaling, but the mechanism by which they influence Hippo signaling has remained unclear. We have investigated the role and regulation of the Drosophila {beta}-heavy Spectrin ({beta}H-Spectrin, encoded by the karst gene) in wing imaginal discs. Our results establish that {beta}H-Spectrin regulates Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway due to its influence on cytoskeletal tension. While we find that -Spectrin also regulates Hippo signaling through Jub, unexpectedly, we find that {beta}H-Spectrin localizes and functions independently of -Spectrin. Instead, {beta}H-Spectrin co-localizes with and reciprocally regulates and is regulated by myosin. In vivo and in vitro experiments support a model in which {beta}H-Spectrin and myosin directly compete for binding to apical F-actin. This competition can explain the influence of {beta}H-Spectrin on cytoskeletal tension and myosin accumulation. It also provides new insight into how {beta}H-Spectrin participates in ratcheting mechanisms associated with cell shape change."

    "abstract": "BackgroundCatalytic class IA PI 3-kinase isoform p110 is a crucial regulator of cellular proliferation and survival in numerous cell types. While p110 is critically involved in pathogenic vascular remodeling, its physiological role for vascular integrity under stress conditions has not been studied. We report a protective function of smooth muscle p110 against abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation.\n\nMethods & ResultsIn mice lacking p110 in smooth muscle cells (sm-p110-/-), perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) yielded substantially enhanced AAA formation compared to wild type controls. This disease phenotype is partly attributable to a subtle preexisting vascular phenotype under basal conditions, as sm-p110-/- mice displayed a smaller media area, deranged aortic wall structure (detached smooth muscle cells, increased apoptotic cell death), and a diminished functional responsiveness of aortic rings to vasodilators. Furthermore, p110 is also implicated in regenerative processes during AAA development: Whereas wild type mice showed increased media hypertrophy, neointima formation and proliferation upon PPE intervention, these vascular remodeling processes were diminished in sm-p110-/- mice. Concomitantly, increased numbers of elastic fiber breaks and ECM degradation were detected in sm-p110-/- aorta. Mechanistically, we found that lack of p110 expression impaired smooth muscle cell proliferation, expression of contractile marker genes and production of elastin fibers. This phenotype largely depended on reduced phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO1, as specific FOXO1 inhibition fully rescued proliferation of p110-/- smooth muscle cells, and knockdown of FOXO1 increased expression of calponin and elastin.\n\nConclusionsSmooth muscle p110 protects against AAA disease by maintaining aortic wall homoeostasis and promoting SMC proliferation to compensate for cell loss during AAA development. Our findings have potential implications for current approaches aimed at p110 inhibition for cancer therapy and suggest new pharmacological strategies to activate p110 signaling in AAA disease."

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypertrophic scars can cause pain, movement restrictions, and reduction of quality of life. Despite numerous options to tackle hypertrophic scarring, efficient therapies are still scarce, and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Secreted factors from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) were previously described for their beneficial effects in tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the effects of PBMCsec on skin scarring in mouse models and human scar explant cultures at single cell resolution (scRNAseq).\n\nMethodsMouse wounds and scars were treated with PBMCsec either intradermally or topically. Human mature scars were treated with PBMCsec ex vivo in explant cultures. All experimental settings were analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). A variety of bioinformatics approaches were used to decipher gene regulation in the scRNAseq data sets. Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were investigated in situ by immunofluorescence. The effect of PBMCsec on myofibroblast differentiation and elastin expression was investigated by stimulating human primary fibroblasts with TGF{beta}.\n\nFindingsTopical and intradermal application of PBMCsec regulated the expression of a variety of genes involved in pro-fibrotic processes and tissue remodeling. Our bioinformatics approach identified elastin as a common linchpin of antifibrotic action in both, the mouse and human experimental setting. In vitro, we found that PBMCsec prevents TGF{beta}-mediated myofibroblast-differentiation and attenuates abundant elastin expression through non-canonical signaling inhibition. Furthermore, TGF{beta}-induced breakdown of elastic fibers was strongly inhibited by addition of PBMCsec.\n\nInterpretationTogether, we showed anti-fibrotic effect of PBMCsec on cutaneous scars in mouse and human experimental settings, suggesting PBMCsec as a novel therapeutic option to treat skin scarring.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSParacrine factors secreted from irradiated peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) show strong tissue regenerative properties in a variety of organs and are shown to enhance cutaneous wound healing. Whether PBMCsec shows anti-fibrotic properties on scar formation has not been investigated so far.\n\nAdded value of this studyIn the present study, we were able to demonstrate that PBMCsec improves quality of developing and mature scars in mouse and human scar tissue. We found that PBMCsec is able to attenuate the expression of various genes, promoting scar formation and inhibit TGF{beta}-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Elastin and TXNIP were identified as a common linchpin of its anti-fibrotic action.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceUsing in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models and analyses on a single-cell level, our study paves the way for clinical studies evaluating the use of PBMCsec for the treatment of human cutaneous scars."

In humans, they consist of TTAGGG repeats, which are bound by dedicated proteins such as the shelterin complex. This complex blocks unwanted DNA damage repair at telomeres, e.g. by suppressing non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) through its subunit TRF2. We here describe ZNF524, a zinc finger protein that directly binds telomeric repeats with nanomolar affinity and reveal the base-specific sequence recognition by co-crystallization with telomeric DNA. ZNF524 localizes to telomeres and specifically maintains the presence of the TRF2/RAP1 subcomplex at telomeres without affecting other shelterin members. Loss of ZNF524 concomitantly results in an increase in DNA damage signaling and recombination events. Overall, ZNF524 is a direct telomere-binding protein involved in the maintenance of telomere integrity."

Centrioles appear in 2-4 cell embryos in fertilized oocytes and in parthenogenetic embryos. Centriole formation includes the appearance of atypical centrioles with randomly arranged triplets and centrioles with microtubule triplets of various lengths. After the third cleavage, four centriolar cylinders for the first time appear in the blastomeres while each embryo still has two atypical centrioles.

We show that blocking import machinery has profound effects on mitochondrial ultra-structure and dynamics, but surprisingly little impact on import. The explanation is a remarkable mechanism in which healthy cells transfer mitochondria to cells with deficient mitochondrial import, and vice versa, through connecting tunnelling nanotubes. These observations suggest the existence of a widespread mechanism for rescue of mitochondrial import function in complex multicellular organisms.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA mitochondrial import rescue mechanism involving intercellular mitochondrial transport through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)."

Neurons and glia both contain long cytoplasmic processes with important functions. While mRNA localization has been studied extensively in neurons, little is known in glia, especially in intact nervous systems. Here, we predicted 1700 localized Drosophila glial transcripts by extrapolating from our meta-analysis of 8 existing studies characterizing the localized transcriptomes and translatomes of synaptically-associated mammalian glia. We tested these predictions in glia of the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila larvae and found that localization to vertebrate glia is a strong predictor of mRNA localization of the high confidence Drosophila homologues. We further showed that some of these localized transcripts are required in glia for plasticity of neuromuscular junction synapses. We conclude that peripheral glial mRNA localization is a common and conserved phenomenon and propose that it is likely to be functionally important."

The TMP-fused virion RNAP transcribes pre-early phage genes, including a gene that encodes another, non-virion RNAP, that transcribes early and some middle phage genes. We determined the crystal structures of both P23-45 RNAPs. The non-virion RNAP has a crab claw-like architecture similar to previously reported two-barrel RNAPs. The virion RNAP adopts a unique flat structure without a clamp, which likely reflects the requirement for its extrusion through the narrow channel in the phage tail for delivery into the cell. Structure and sequence comparisons of the P23-45 RNAPs with other phage and cellular RNAPs suggest that, despite the extensive functional differences, the two P23-45 RNAPs originate from an ancient gene duplication in an ancestral phage. Our findings demonstrate remarkable adaptability of two-barrel RNAPs that can be attained within a single virus species."

    "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare human genetic condition characterized by altered skeletal development and extra-skeletal bone formation. All cases of FOP are caused by mutations in the type I BMP receptor gene ACVR1 that result in over-activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Activation of the wild-type ACVR1 kinase requires assembly of a tetrameric type I and II BMP receptor complex followed by phosphorylation of the ACVR1 GS domain by type II BMP receptors. Previous studies showed that the FOP mutant ACVR1-R206H requires type II BMP receptors and presumptive GS domain phosphorylation for over-active signaling. Structural modeling of the FOP-ACVR1 mutant kinase domain supports that FOP mutations alter the conformation of the GS domain, but it is unclear how this leads to overactive signaling. Here we show using a developing zebrafish embryo BMP signaling assay that the FOP mutant receptors ACVR1-R206H and -G328R have reduced requirements for GS domain phosphorylation sites to signal compared to wild-type ACVR1. Further, ligandindependent and ligand-dependent signaling through the FOP ACVR1 receptors have distinct GS domain phosphorylation site requirements. Moreover, ACVR1-G328 showed increased GS domain serine/threonine requirements for ligand-independent signaling compared to ACVR1-R206H, whereas it exhibited reduced serine/threonine requirements for ligand-dependent signaling. Remarkably, while ACVR1-R206H does not require the type I BMP receptor partner, Bmpr1, to signal, a ligand-dependent GS domain mutant of ACVR1-R206H could signal independently of Bmpr1 only when Bmp7 ligand was overexpressed. Of note, unlike human ACVR1-R206H, the zebrafish paralog Acvr1l-R203H does not show increased signaling activity. However, in domain-swapping studies the human kinase domain, but not the human GS domain, was sufficient to confer overactive signaling to the Acvr1l-R203H receptor. Together these results reflect the importance of GS domain activation and kinase domain functions in regulating ACVR1 signaling and identify mechanisms of reduced regulatory constraints conferred by FOP mutations."

    "abstract": "Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia hordei, is one of the most widespread and damaging foliar diseases affecting barley (Hordeum spp.). The barley leaf rust resistance locus Rph7, located on the short arm of chromosome 3H, confers defence at all growth stages and was previously shown to have unusually high sequence and haplotype divergence. Earlier, four candidate genes for Rph7 were reported and, despite an in-depth comparative sequence analysis and haplotypic characterisation, the causal gene could not be resolved. Here, we successfully cloned Rph7 utilising a fine mapping approach in combination with an RNA-Seq based expression analysis. We identified three up-regulated and pathogen-induced genes with presence/absence variation (PAV) at this locus. Sequence analysis of chemically induced Rph7 knockout mutant lines identified multiple independent non-synonymous variants, including a premature stop codon in a single non-canonical resistance gene that encodes a 302-amino acid protein. Progeny from four independent transgenic lines segregated for the expected avirulent Rph7 infection type in response to several avirulent P. hordei pathotypes, however, all plants were susceptible to a single virulent pathotype confirming the specificity. Structural analysis using an AlphaFold2 protein model suggests that Rph7 encodes a putative NAC transcription factor, as it shares structural similarity to ANAC019 from Arabidopsis, with a C-terminal BED domain. A global gene expression analysis suggests Rph7 is involved in the activation of basal defence."

    "date": "2022-12-01",
    "relevance": "4 Very Relevant",
    "abstract": "Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic loci, is known to play an important role in the phenotypic variation of complex traits. As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In this study, we present the \"multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test\" (mvMAPIT) -- a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact -- thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search-based methods. Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate mvMAPIT as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized GWA studies. With simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvMAPIT over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies. We also apply mvMAPIT framework to protein sequence data from two broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies and approximately 2,000 heterogenous stock of mice from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.

    "abstract": "Contacts between enhancers and promoters are thought to relate to their ability to activate transcription. Investigating mechanisms that drive such chromatin interactions is therefore important for understanding gene regulation. Here, we have determined contact frequencies between millions of pairs of cis-regulatory elements from chromosome conformation capture datasets and analysed a collection of hundreds of DNA-binding factors for binding at regions of enriched contacts. This analysis revealed enriched contacts at sites bound by many factors associated with active transcription. We show that active regulatory elements, independent of cohesin and polycomb, interact with each other across distances of 10s of megabases in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes and that interactions correlate and change with activity. However, these ultra-long-range interactions are not dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription or several transcription cofactors. We propose that long-range interactions between cis-regulatory elements are driven by three distinct mechanisms - cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, polycomb contacts, and association between active regions."

Here, we scrutinize proposed oligomerization models in live cells, establishing a molecular sensitive imaging toolkit including time-resolved FRET spectroscopy, quantitative STED microscopy, confocal Photobleaching Step Analysis and FCS. CD95 interactions were probed over molecular concentrations of few to [~] 1000 molecules/{micro}m2, over ns to hours, and molecular to cellular scales.

Efficient apoptosis was already observed when [~] 8 to 17% monomeric CD95 oligomerize to dimers/trimers after ligand binding. Our multiscale study highlights the importance of molecular concentrations, of the native environment, and reveals a minimal oligomerization model of CD95 signal initiation."

    "abstract": "Modern mass spectrometers routinely allow deep proteome coverage in a single experiment. These methods are typically operated at nano and micro flow regimes, but they often lack throughput and chromatographic robustness, which is critical for large-scale studies. In this context, we have developed, optimized and benchmarked LC-MS methods combining the robustness and throughput of analytical flow chromatography with the added sensitivity provided by the Zeno trap across a wide range of cynomolgus monkey and human matrices of interest for toxicological studies and clinical biomarker discovery. SWATH data independent acquisition (DIA) experiments with Zeno trap activated (Zeno SWATH DIA) provided a clear advantage over conventional SWATH DIA in all sample types tested with improved sensitivity, quantitative robustness and signal linearity as well as increased protein coverage by up to 9-fold. Using a 10-min gradient chromatography, up to 3,300 proteins were identified in tissues at 2 {micro}g peptide load. Importantly, the performance gains with Zeno SWATH translated into better biological pathway representation and improved the ability to identify dysregulated proteins and pathways associated with two metabolic diseases in human plasma. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is highly stable over time with the acquisition of reliable data over the injection of 1,000+ samples (14.2 days of uninterrupted acquisition) without the need for human intervention or normalization. Altogether, Zeno SWATH DIA methodology allows fast, sensitive and robust proteomic workflows using analytical flow and is amenable to large-scale studies. This work provides detailed method performance assessment on a variety of relevant biological matrices and serves as a valuable resource for the proteomics community."

To better understand how dominant negative effects on fibrillin microfibril stability manifest in growth factor driven aortic disease, we analyzed early events of aortic aneurysm formation within the first two weeks of postnatal life in the dominant negative Fbn1 GT8 Marfan mouse model. Echocardiography analysis of homozygous GT8 Fbn1 mice showed significant aortic root enlargement within the second week of postnatal life which correlated with the onset of fibrillin-1 fiber degradation, aberrantly increased BMP activity and upregulated transcript levels of the collagenase MMP-13. We also found the aortic collagen network structurally disturbed where the mutant GT8-fibrillin-1 was detected. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP-13 in Fbn1 GT8 Marfan mice prevents aortic root dilatation implicating the relevance of this mechanism in aortic aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome."

    "relevance": "1 Certainly Irrelevant",
    "abstract": "Cys2-His2 Zinc finger genes (ZNFs) form the largest family of transcription factors in metazoans. ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a major role in the diversification of the Kruppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily, which predominates in tetrapod genomes. At present, it is unknown whether this function and co-evolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs, or a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver in the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from more than 4000 animal genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution, both within and between major taxonomic groups. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in a diverse set of representative animal species. We further investigate one of the most expansive ZNF subfamilies found in cyprinid fish, which are characterized by a conserved domain we dubbed the Fish N-terminal Zinc-finger associated (FiNZ) domain. FiNZ-ZNFs have dramatically expanded in several fish species, including the zebrafish in which we predict ~700 FiNZ-ZNF genes. Almost all are located on the long arm of chromosome 4, and recent duplicates are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, the bulk of zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed in waves at the onset of zygotic genome activation. Blocking FiNZ-ZNF translation using morpholinos during early zebrafish embryogenesis results in a global de-repression of young, transcriptionally active TEs, likely driven by the failure to establish heterochromatin over these elements. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution and that families of ZNFs have been deployed independently in fish and mammals to repress TEs during early embryogenesis."

    "abstract": "Background and aimsInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes both Crohns Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a relapsing inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Long term chronic inflammatory conditions elevate patients risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Currently, diagnosis requires endoscopy with biopsy. This procedure is invasive and requires bowel preparatory regimen, adding to patient burden. Interleukin 23 (IL23) plays a key role in inflammation especially in the pathogenesis of IBD and is an established therapeutic target. We propose that imaging of IL23 via immunopositron emission tomography (immunoPET) will potentially lead to a new non-invasive diagnostic approach.\n\nMethodsThe aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of immunoPET to image inflammation in a chemically induced mouse model of colitis using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) by targeting IL23 via its p40 subunit with a 89Zr-radiolabeled -IL23p40 antibody.\n\nResultsHigh uptake of the IL23p40 immunoPET agent in mice were displayed in DSS-administered mice, which correlated with increased IL23p40 present in sera. Competitive binding studies confirmed the specificity of the radiotracer for IL23p40 in the GI tract.\n\nConclusionTaken together, these promising results set the stage for developing this radiotracer as an imaging biomarker for IBD diagnosis. Noninvasive imaging of IBD with IL23p40 immunoPET may help physicians in their treatment decisions for IBD management."

    "abstract": "Demixing of proteins and nucleic acids into condensed liquid phases is rapidly emerging as a ubiquitous mechanism underlying the complex spatiotemporal organisation of molecules within the cell. Long disordered regions of low sequence complexity (LCRs) are a common feature of proteins that form liquid-like microscopic biomolecular condensates. In particular, RNA-binding proteins with prion-like composition have been highlighted as key drivers of liquid demixing to form condensates such as the nucleolus, paraspeckles and stress granules. Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein essential for DNA repair and paraspeckle formation. SFPQ contains two LCRs of different length and composition. Here, we show that the shorter C-terminal LCR of SFPQ is the main region responsible for the condensation of SFPQ in vitro and in the cell nucleus. In contrast, we find that, unexpectedly, the longer N-terminal prion-like LCR of SFPQ actually attenuates condensation of the full-length protein, suggesting a more regulatory role in preventing aberrant condensate formation in the cell. Our data add nuance to the emerging understanding of biomolecular condensate formation, by providing the first example of a common multifunctional nucleic acid-binding protein with an extensive prion-like region that serves to regulate rather than drive condensate formation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518278v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3697a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d5184org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2e789org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ee955_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

To facilitate new approaches for research, biomedicine, and biotechnological applications, we developed a set of arabinose-inducible artificial transcription factors (ATFs) using CRISPR/dCas9 and Arabidopsis-derived DNA-binding proteins, allowing to control gene expression in E. coli and Salmonella over a wide inducer concentration range. As a proof-of-concept, we employed the developed ATFs to engineer a Salmonella biosensor strain, SALSOR 0.2 (SALmonella biosenSOR 0.2), which responds to the presence of alkaloid drugs with quantifiable fluorescent output. We demonstrated that SALSOR 0.2 was able to detect the presence of the antitussive noscapine alkaloid with ~2.3-fold increased fluorescent signal over background noise compared to a previously described biosensor. Moreover, we used plant-derived ATFs to control {beta}-carotene biosynthesis in E. coli, which resulted in ~1.6-fold higher {beta}-carotene production compared to expression of the biosynthesis pathway using a strong constitutive promoter. The arabinose-inducible ATFs reported here thus enhance the synthetic biology repertoire of transcriptional regulatory modules that allow tuning protein expression in the Gram-negative model organisms Salmonella and E. coli."

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that the PRC2 chromatin-modifying enzyme exhibits the ability to directly transfer between RNA and DNA without a free-enzyme intermediate state. Simulations suggested that such a direct transfer mechanism may be generally necessary for RNA to recruit proteins to chromatin, but the prevalence of direct transfer capability is unknown. Herein, we used fluorescence polarization assays and observed direct transfer for several well-characterized nucleic acid-binding proteins: three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, Fem-3-binding factor 2, and MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. For TREX1, the direct transfer mechanism was additionally interrogated by single molecule assays, and the data suggest that direct transfer occurs through an unstable ternary intermediate with partially associated ligands. Generally, direct transfer could allow many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins to conduct a one-dimensional search for their target sites. Furthermore, presumably long-lived protein-polynucleotide complexes might instead be readily replaced by other protein-polynucleotide complexes in vivo.\n\nSignificanceClassically, the lifetime of a protein-ligand complex is presumed to be an intrinsic property, unaffected by competitor molecules in free solution. By contrast, a few oligomeric nucleic acid binding proteins have been observed to exchange competing ligands in their binding sites, and consequently their lifetimes decrease with competitor concentration. Our findings indicate that this \"direct transfer\" is a more general property of nucleic acid binding proteins. This suggests that many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins can reduce the dimensionality of their search for their target sites by intramolecular direct transfer to nucleosome DNA, instead of relying entirely on three-dimensional diffusion, and it suggests that their mean complex lifetimes in vivo can be regulated by the concentration of free ligand molecules."

    "abstract": "Since 2000 some thirteen quinolones/fluoroquinolones have been developed and come to market. The quinolones, one of the most successful classes of antibacterial drugs, stabilize DNA-cleavage complexes with DNA gyrase and topo IV, the two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. The dual targeting of gyrase and topo IV helps decrease the likelihood of resistance developing. Here we report a 2.8 [A] X-ray crystal structure which shows that zoliflodacin, a spiropyrimidinetrione antibiotic, binds in the same DNA-cleavage site(s) as quinolones sterically blocking DNA religation. The structure shows that zoliflodacin interacts with highly conserved residues on GyrB (and does not use the quinolone water-metal ion bridge to GyrA) suggesting it may be more difficult for bacteria to develop target mediated resistance. We found that zoliflodacin had an MIC of 4 {micro}g/mL against Acinetobacter baumannii, an improvement of 4-fold over its progenitor QPT-1. The current phase III clinical trial of zoliflodacin for gonorrhea is due to be read out in 2023. Zoliflodacin, together with the unrelated novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor gepotidacin, are likely to become the first entirely novel chemical entities approved against Gram-negative bacteria in the 21st century. Zoliflodacin may also become the progenitor of a new safer class of antibacterial drugs against other problematic Gram-negative bacteria."

    "abstract": "The chromatin-modifying enzyme, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), deposits the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark to negatively regulate expression at numerous target genes, and this activity has been implicated in embryonic development, cell differentiation, and various cancers. A biological role for RNA binding in regulating PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity is generally accepted, but the nature and mechanism of this relationship remains an area of active investigation. Notably, many in vitro studies demonstrate that RNA inhibits PRC2 activity on nucleosomes through mutually antagonistic binding, while some in vivo studies indicate that PRC2s RNA-binding activity is critical for facilitating its biological function(s). Here we use biochemical, biophysical, and computational approaches to interrogate PRC2s RNA and DNA binding kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that PRC2-polynucleotide dissociation rates are dependent on the concentration of free ligand, indicating the potential for direct transfer between ligands without a free-enzyme intermediate. Direct transfer explains the variation in dissociation kinetics reported previously, allows reconciliation of prior in vitro and in vivo studies, and expands the potential mechanisms of RNA-mediated PRC2 regulation. Moreover, simulations indicate that such a direct transfer mechanism could be obligatory for RNA to recruit proteins to chromatin.\n\nSignificanceStudies of PRC2 in vitro indicate that RNA inhibits its histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity through mutually antagonistic binding with nucleosomes, but some in vivo studies paradoxically suggest that RNA binding is necessary to facilitate chromatin occupancy and HMTase activity. Our findings unveil a protein-intrinsic mechanism for directly exchanging RNA and DNA/nucleosome in PRC2s binding site(s), which reconciles these prior findings by allowing antagonistic or synergistic RNA-mediated regulation dependent on RNA-nucleosome proximity. Furthermore, there is an increasing awareness that multiple chromatin-associated proteins exhibit regulatory RNA binding activity, and our findings indicate this \"direct transfer\" mechanism may be generally required for such regulation."

Population strongholds in Mongolia and China face growing challenges from climate change, habitat fragmentation, poaching, and other sources. These threats, combined with O. manuls zoo collection popularity and value in evolutionary biology, necessitate improvement of species genomic resources. We used standalone nanopore sequencing to assemble a 2.5 Gb, 61-contig nuclear assembly and 17,097 bp mitogenome for O. manul. The primary nuclear assembly had 56x sequencing coverage, a contig N50 of 118 Mb, and a 94.7% BUSCO completeness score for Carnivora-specific genes. High genome collinearity within Felidae permitted alignment-based scaffolding onto the fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) reference genome. Manul contigs spanned all 19 felid chromosomes with an inferred total gap length of less than 400 kilobases. Modified basecalling and variant phasing produced an alternate pseudohaplotype assembly and allele-specific DNA methylation calls; sixty-one differentially methylated regions were identified between haplotypes.

We discover essential roles for the UPRmt in both protecting and repairing proteostasis, with oxidative phosphorylation metabolism being a central target of the UPRmt. Transcriptome analyses together with MitoPQ reveal that UPRmt transcription factors drive independent signaling arms that act in concert to maintain proteostasis. Unidirectional interplay between the UPRmt and PINK1/Parkin mitophagy was found to promote oxidative phosphorylation recovery when the UPRmt failed. Collectively, this study defines the network of proteostasis mediated by the UPRmt and highlights the value of functional proteomics in decoding stressed proteomes."

    "abstract": "In S phase, duplication and assembly of the whole genome into chromatin requires upregulation of replicative histone gene expression. Here, we explored a potential role of histone chaperones in this process thereby linking chromatin assembly with histone production in human cells. Depletion of the ASF1 chaperone specifically decreased the pool of replicative histones both at the levels of soluble protein and total RNA, while depletion of CAF-1 did not. Most replicative histone genes decreased in their overall expression as revealed by total RNA-seq. In contrast, both their newly synthesized RNAs and nascent RNAs at transcription sites increased as shown by 4sU-labeled RNA-seq and single-molecule RNA FISH, respectively. Further inspection of the sequences corresponding to replicative histone RNAs showed a 3 processing defect, leading to unprocessed transcripts usually targeted for degradation. We discuss how this regulation of replicative histone RNA metabolism by ASF1 fine-tunes the histone dosage to avoid unbalanced situations deleterious for cell survival."

    "abstract": "An important transcript structural element is its 3 polyadenylated (polyA) tail, which defines the 3 boundary of the transcripts genetic information and is necessary for transcript stability. The position of the polyA tail can vary, with multiple alternatively polyadenylated (APA) transcripts existing for a single gene. This can lead to different length transcripts which can vary in their 3 regulatory domains and even by inclusion or exclusion of protein-coding introns. The distribution of polyA tail location on articular chondrocyte transcripts has not been examined before and this study aimed to be the first to define polyadenylation events in human chondrocytes using age-matched healthy and osteoarthritic knee articular cartilage samples. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples and analysed using the QuantSeqReverse 3 RNA Sequencing approach, where each read runs 3 to 5 from within the polyA tail into the transcript and will contains a distinct polyA site. Initial analysis of differential expression of overall transcript abundance identified by the reads showed significant disruption to transcript levels when healthy samples were compared to osteoarthritic ones. As we expected, differentially regulated genes were enriched with functionalities that were strongly associated with joint pathology. As part of this analysis, we also identified a substantial number of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs that had not been linked to osteoarthritis before. Subsequent examination of polyA site data allowed us to deifne the extent of site usage across all the samples. This included identification of chondrocyte genes that exhibited the greatest amount polyA site variation. When comparing healthy and osteoarthritic samples, we found that differential use of polyadenylation sites was modest. However, of the small number of genes affected, there was clear potential for the change in polyadenylation site usage elicited by pathology to have functional relevance. We examined two genes, OSMR and KMT2A, in more detail, defining how APA affects transcript turnover and then, in the case of OSMR, identifying that APA is sensitive to inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Overall, we have characterised the polyadenylation landscape of human knee articular chondrocytes but can conclude that osteoarthritis does not elicit a widespread change in their polyadenylation site usage. This finding differentiates knee osteoarthritis from pathologies such as cancer where APA is more commonly observed."

    "abstract": "The ability to manipulate cellular function using an external stimulus is a powerful strategy for studying complex biological phenomena. One approach to modulate the function of the cellular environment is split proteins. In this method, a biologically active protein or an enzyme is fragmented so that it reassembles only upon a specific stimulus. While there are many tools available to induce these systems, nature has provided other mechanisms that can be utilized to expand the split protein toolbox. Here we show a novel method for reconstituting split proteins using magnetic stimulation. We have found that the Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG) changes conformation due to magnetic fields stimulation. By fusing split fragments of a certain protein to both termini of the EPG, the fragments can be reassembled into a functional protein under magnetic stimulation due to conformational change. We show this effect with three separate split proteins; NanoLuc, APEX2, and Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Thymidine Kinase. Our results show for the first time, that reconstitution of split proteins can be achieved only with magnetic fields. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future magnetically inducible split protein designs for cellular perturbation and manipulation. With this technology, we can help to expand the toolbox of the split protein platform and allow better elucidation of complex biological systems."

Despite extensive studies on how phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins and translation factors enables timely response to exogenous stimuli4, our knowledge on molecular pathways utilized by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to control translation of specific mRNAs remains incomplete. We have previously found that YTHDF1 regulates depolarization-induced protein synthesis by promoting translation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified transcripts5. Here we report an unexpected mechanism that the stimuli-induced neuronal translation is mediated by phosphorylation of a YTHDF1-binding protein FMRP. Phosphorylation of FMRP serine 499 induced by neuronal depolarization alters the condensing behavior of prion-like protein YTHDF1. Unphosphorylated FMRP sequesters YTHDF1 away from the translation initiation complex, whereas the stimulation-induced FMRP phosphorylation releases YTHDF1 to form translational active condensates with the ribosome to activate translation of YTHDF1 target transcripts. In fragile X syndrome (FXS) models characterized by low FMRP expression, we observed YTHDF1-mediated hyperactive translation, which notably impacts FXS pathophysiology. Developmental defects in an FXS forebrain organoid model could be reversed by a selective small-molecule inhibitor of YTHDF1 which acts by suppressing its condensation in neurons. We characterized transcriptome-wide mRNA translation with inhibitor treatment in organoids and identified targets that explain alleviated FXS pathology. Our study thus reveals FMRP and its phosphorylation as an important regulator of the activity-dependent translation during neuronal development and stimulation, and identifies YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target for FXS in which developmental defects caused by FMRP depletion could be reversed through YTHDF1 inhibition."

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) protein 1 (TAL1) is a central transcription factor in hematopoiesis. The timing and level of TAL1 expression orchestrate the differentiation to specialized blood cells and its overexpression is a common cause of T-ALL. Here we studied the two protein isoforms of TAL1, short and long, that are generated by the use of alternative promoters as well as by alternative splicing. We analyzed the expression of each isoform by deleting an enhancer or insulator, or by opening chromatin at the enhancer location. Our results show that each enhancer promotes expression from a specific TAL1 promoter. Expression from a specific promoter gives rise to a unique 5 UTR with differential regulation of translation. In addition, the enhancers regulate TAL1 exon 3 alternative splicing by altering the chromatin at its location. Furthermore, our results indicate that TAL1-short binds more strongly to TAL1 E-protein partners and functions as a stronger transcription factor than TAL1-long. Specifically TAL1-short has a unique transcription signature promoting apoptosis. Finally, when we expressed both isoforms in mice bone-marrow, we found that while overexpression of both isoforms prevents lymphoid differentiation, expression of TAL-short alone leads to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we found that TAL1-short promoted erythropoiesis and reduced cell survival in the CML cell line K562. While TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-ALL, our results show that TAL1-short could act as a tumor suppressor and suggest that altering TAL1 isoforms ratio could be a preferred therapeutic approach."

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been on a rampage for more than two years. Vaccines in combination with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 carry great hope in the treatment and final elimination of COVID-19. However, the relentless emergence of variants of concern (VOC), including the most recent Omicron variants, presses for novel measures to counter these variants that often show immune evasion. Hereby we developed a targeted photodynamic approach to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by engineering a genetically encoded photosensitizer (SOPP3) to a diverse list of antibodies targeting the WT spike protein, including human antibodies isolated from a 2003 SARS patient, potent monomeric and multimeric nanobodies targeting RBD, and non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs) targeting the more conserved NTD region. As confirmed by pseudovirus neutralization assay, this targeted photodynamic approach significantly increased the efficacy of these antibodies, especially that of non-NAbs, against not only the WT but also the Delta strain and the heavily immune escape Omicron strain (BA.1). Subsequent measurement of infrared phosphorescence at 1270 nm confirmed the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in the photodynamic process. Mass spectroscopy assay uncovered amino acids in the spike protein targeted by 1O2. Impressively, Y145 and H146 form an oxidization \"hotspot\", which overlaps with the antigenic \"supersite\" in NTD. Taken together, our study established a targeted photodynamic approach against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and provided mechanistic insights into the photodynamic modification of protein molecules mediated by 1O2."

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP) trims peptide precursors in the ER for presentation by major histocompatibility (MHC)-I molecules to surveying CD8+ T-cells. This function allows ERAAP to regulate the nature and quality of the peptide repertoire and, accordingly, the resulting immune responses. We recently showed that infection with murine cytomegalovirus leads to a dramatic loss of ERAAP levels in infected cells. In mice, this loss is associated with the activation of QFL T-cells, a subset of T-cells that monitor ERAAP integrity and eliminate cells experiencing ERAAP dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to identify host factors that regulate ERAAP expression level and determine whether these could be manipulated during viral infections. We performed a CRISPR knockout screen and identified ERp44 as a factor promoting ERAAP retention in the ER. ERp44s interaction with ERAAP is dependent on the pH gradient between the ER and Golgi. We hypothesized that viruses that disrupt the pH of the secretory pathway interfere with ERAAP retention. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the Envelope (E) protein from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to Golgi pH neutralization and consequently decrease of ERAAP intracellular levels. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced ERAAP loss correlates with its release into the extracellular environment. ERAAPs reliance on ERp44 and a functioning ER/Golgi pH gradient for proper localization and function led us to propose that ERAAP serves as a sensor of disturbances in the secretory pathway during infection and disease."

Aptamers are short, single-stranded oligonucleotides (RNA/DNA) that bind to target proteins and other types of biomolecules. Compared with small-molecule drugs, aptamers can bind to their targets with high affinity (binding strength) and specificity (uniquely interacting with the target only). The conventional development process for aptamers utilizes a manual process known as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), which is costly, slow, dependent on library choice and often produces aptamers that are not optimized. To address these challenges, in this research, we create an intelligent approach, named DAPTEV, for generating and evolving aptamer sequences to support aptamer-based drug discovery and development. Using the COVID-19 spike protein as a target, our computational results suggest that DAPTEV is able to produce structurally complex aptamers with strong binding affinities.\n\nAuthor summaryCompared with small-molecule drugs, aptamer drugs are short RNAs/DNAs that can specifically bind to targets with high strength.

Understanding the pathogenesis and biomarkers associated with responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain critical components in developing effective therapeutic approaches, especially in cases of severe and long-COVID-19. In this study blood plasma protein expression was compared in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease. Evaluation of an inflammatory protein panel confirms upregulation of proteins including TNF{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, already associated with severe cytokine storm and progression to severe COVID-19. Importantly, we identify several proteins not yet associated with COVID-19 disease, including mesothelin (MSLN), that are expressed at significantly higher levels in severe COVID-19 subjects. In addition, we find a subset of markers associated with T-cell and dendritic cell responses to viral infection that are significantly higher in mild cases and decrease in expression as severity of COVID-19 increases, suggesting that an immediate and effective activation of T-cells is critical in modulating disease progression. Together, our findings identify new targets for further investigation as therapeutic approaches for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevention of complications of severe COVID-19."

    "abstract": "1Natural movement is clearly related to health, however, it is also highly complex and difficult to measure. Most attempts to measure it focus on functional movements in humans, and while this a valid and popular approach, assays focussed on particular movements cannot capture the range of natural movement that occurs outside them. It is also difficult to use current techniques to compare movement across different animal species. This type of interspecies comparison may be useful for identifying conserved computational principles of movement that guide human and veterinary medicine, plus several other fields of research. It is therefore important that research develops a system for quantifying movement in freely moving animals in natural environments and relating it to length and quality of life. The present text proposes a theoretical framework for doing so, within which movement is defined as movement ability (MA). MA is comprised of three major variables - Movement Quality, Movement Complexity, and Movement Quantity - that may be used to capture what are perhaps the most important components of movement as it relates to length and quality of life. The framework requires validation, however, it represents a novel and potentially important paradigm for considering movement, which may influence how present and future work is conducted."

However, they have difficulty distinguishing synchrony and indirect effects from direct causation, leading to false predictions. To overcome this, model-based inference methods were developed that test the reproducibility of data with a specific mechanistic model to infer causality. However, they can only be applied to systems described by a specific model, greatly limiting their applicability. Here, we address this limitation by deriving an easily-testable condition for a general ODE model to reproduce time-series data. We built a user-friendly computational package, GOBI (General ODE-Based Inference), which is applicable to nearly any system described by ODE. GOBI successfully inferred positive and negative regulations in various networks at both molecular and population levels, unlike existing model-free methods. Thus, this accurate and broadly-applicable inference method is a powerful tool for understanding complex dynamical systems."

Moreover, NME6 supports the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA when the access to cytosolic deoxyribonucleotides is limited. Perturbation of NME6 leads to the depletion of mitochondrial transcripts, destabilisation of the electron transport chain and impaired oxidative phosphorylation; deficiencies which are suppressed upon supplementation with pyrimidine ribonucleotides. Our work proposes NME6 and mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism to be untapped therapeutic targets in diseases associated with aberrant mitochondrial gene expression including cancer and autoimmune disorders."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has become a standard tool in the quantitative analysis of sub-cellular environments. However, quantitative FLIM analyses face several challenges. First, spatial correlations between pixels are often ignored as signal from individual pixels is analyzed independently thereby limiting spatial resolution. Second, existing methods deduce photon ratios instead of absolute lifetime maps. Next, the number of lifetime components contributing to the signal is unknown, while excited state lifetimes with <1 ns difference are difficult to discriminate. Finally, existing analyses require high photon budgets, and often cannot rigorously propagate experimental uncertainty into values over lifetime maps and number of components involved. To overcome all of these challenges simultaneously and self-consistently at once, we propose the first doubly nonparametric framework. That is, we learn the number of fluorescent species (through beta-Bernoulli process priors) and absolute lifetime maps of these species (through Gaussian process priors) by leveraging information from pulses not leading to observed photon. We benchmark our algorithm using a broad range of synthetic and experimental data and demonstrate its robustness across a number of scenarios including cases where we recover lifetime differences between components as small as 0.3 ns with merely 1000 photons."

Recently, a possible relation between respiration and general anesthesia has been found. This work aims to explore whether anesthesia related gases affect the ORR. In ORR, oxygen which is in its triplet ground state is reduced to form products that are all in the singlet state. While this process is \"in principle\" forbidden because of spin conservation, it is known that if the electrons transferred in the ORR are spin polarized, the reaction occurs efficiently. Here we show, in electrochemical experiments, that the efficiency of the oxygen reduction is reduced by the presence of general anesthetics in solution. We suggest that a spin-orbit coupling to the anesthetics depolarizes the spins. This causes both a reduction in reaction efficiency and a change in the reaction products. The findings may point to a possible relation between ORR efficiency and anesthetic action."

Therefore, in silico tools are required for classifying variants with unknown significance. Over the past decades, several computational methods have been developed but they usually have limited accuracy and high false-positive rates.

    "abstract": "Tracheomalacia (TM) is a condition in which the anterior part of the trachea consisting of cartilage and/or the posterior part consisting muscle are too soft to ensure its mechanical support. This situation may result in an excessive and potentially lethal collapse of the airway in the newborns. Current treatment techniques include tracheal reconstruction, tracheoplasty, endo- and extraluminal stents, but are all facing important limitations.\n\nTo reduce the shortcomings of actual TM treatments, this work proposes a new strategy by wrapping an adhesive hydrogel patch extraluminally around a malacic trachea. To validate this approach, first a numerical model revealed that a hydrogel patch with sufficient mechanical and adhesion strength can potentially preserve the tracheas physiological shape. Accordingly, a new hydrogel formulation was synthesized employing the hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAam) and polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGDMA) as main polymer network and crosslinker, respectively. These hydrogels provide excellent adhesion on wet tracheal surfaces, thanks to a two-step photo-polymerization approach. Ex vivo experiments revealed that the developed adhesive hydrogel patches can restrain the collapsing of malacic trachea under applied negative pressure. This study, to be confirmed by in vivo studies, is open to the possibility of a new treatment in the difficult clinical situation of tracheomalacia in newborns."

    "abstract": "Boosting natural mechanisms to retain cellular homeostasis and combat oxidative stress by inducing a hormetic heat shock to retinal pigment epithelium with non-damaging transpupillary laser heating, i.e., with subthreshold laser treatment (SLT), has been suggested as a promising therapeutic target for many retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. However, the therapeutic temperature window for the treatments is narrow and thermal dosimetry is unavailable. Here we introduce an SLT modality where the retinal temperature is monitored with electroretinography (ERG)-based thermal dosimetry and demonstrate its feasibility with anesthetized pigs. In 60-second treatments with 810 nm laser, the ED50 peak temperature for visible lesion generation was 48{degrees}C and the relative temperature determination error was below 10% from the temperature increase. Heat shock protein expression increased, and autophagy was activated at 44.2 {degrees}C and no signs of oxidative stress or apoptosis emerged at 44.2 {degrees}C or 46.5 {degrees}C. The demonstrated method permits a controlled activation of intracellular chaperones and waste clearance in RPE cell with a clear temperature margin for adverse events. In the clinical setting, ERG-based dosimetry would allow safe and personalized SLTs for retinal diseases currently lacking effective treatments."

    "abstract": "While blood gene signatures have shown promise in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment monitoring, most signatures derived from a single cohort may be insufficient to capture TB heterogeneity in populations and individuals. Here we report a new generalized approach combining a network-based meta-analysis with machine-learning modeling to leverage the power of heterogeneity among studies. The transcriptome datasets from 57 studies (37 TB and 20 viral infections) across demographics and TB disease states were used for gene signature discovery and model training and validation. The network-based meta-analysis identified a common 45-gene signature specific to active TB disease across studies. Two optimized random forest regression models, using the full or partial 45-gene signature, were then established to model the continuum from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to disease and treatment response. In model validation, using pooled multi-cohort datasets to mimic the real-world setting, the model provides robust predictive performance for incipient to active TB risk over a 2.5-year period with an AUROC of 0.85, 74.2% sensitivity, and 78.3% specificity, which approximated the minimum criteria (>75% sensitivity and >75% specificity) within the WHO target product profile for prediction of progression to TB. Moreover, the model strongly discriminates active TB from viral infection (AUROC 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.94). For treatment monitoring, the TB scores generated by the model statistically correlate with treatment responses over time and were predictive, even before treatment initiation, of standard treatment clinical outcomes. We demonstrate an end-to-end gene signature model development scheme that considers heterogeneity for TB risk estimation and treatment monitoring.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAn early diagnosis for incipient TB is a one of the key approaches to reduce global TB deaths and incidence, particularly in low and middle-income countries. However, in appreciation of TB heterogenicity at the population and individual level due to TB pathogenesis, host genetics, demographics, disease comorbidities and technical variations from sample collecting and gene profiling, the responses of the molecular gene signatures have showed to be associated with these diverse factors In this work, we develop a new computational approach that combines a network-based meta-analysis with machine-learning modeling to address the existing challenge of early incipient TB prediction against TB heterogenicity. With this new approach, we harness the power of TB heterogeneity in diverse populations and individuals during model construction by including massive datasets (57 studies in total) that allow us not only to consider different confounding variables inherited from each cohort while identifying the common gene set and building the predictive model, but also to systematically validate the model by pooling the datasets to mimic the real-world setting. This generalized predicting model provides a robust prediction of long-term TB risk estimation (>30 months to TB disease). In addition, this model also demonstrates the utility in TB treatment monitoring along with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elimination."

The limited amount of material encapsulated in a single cell however, raises significant technical challenges to molecular profiling. Due to extensive optimization efforts, mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics (scp-MS) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate proteome profiling from ultra-low amounts of input, although further development is needed to realize its full potential. To this end, we carried out comprehensive analysis of orbitrap-based data independent acquisition (DIA) for limited material proteomics. Notably, we found a fundamental difference between optimal DIA methods for high- and low-load samples. We further improved our low-input DIA method by relying on high-resolution MS1 quantification, thus more efficiently utilizing available mass analyzer time. With our ultra-low input tailored DIA method, we were able to accommodate long injection times and high resolution, while keeping the scan cycle time low enough to ensure robust quantification. Finally, we establish a complete experimental scp-MS workflow, combining DIA with accessible single-cell sample preparation and the latest chromatographic and computational advances and showcase our developments by profiling real single cells."

    "abstract": "Epistasis is central in many domains of biology, but it has not yet proven useful for complex traits. This is partly because complex trait epistasis involves polygenic interactions that are poorly captured in current models. To address this gap, we develop a new model called Epistasis Factor Analysis (EFA). EFA assumes that polygenic epistasis can be factorized into interactions between a few latent pathways, or Epistasis Factors (EFs). We mathematically characterize EFA and use simulations to show that EFA outperforms current epistasis models when its assumptions approximately hold. Applied to predicting yeast growth traits, EFA outperforms the additive model for several traits with large epistasis heritability and uniformly outperforms the standard epistasis model, which we replicate in a second dataset. We also apply EFA to four traits in the UK Biobank and find statistically significant evidence for epistasis in male testosterone. Moreover, we find that the inferred EFs partly recover known biological pathways. Our results demonstrate that realistic statistical models can identify meaningful epistasis in complex traits, indicating that epistatic models have promise for precision medicine and characterizing the biology underlying GWAS results."

Here, we report the early responses of murine lungs to nanoparticle-delivered PAMPs, specifically the RIG-I agonist poly-U/UC (PUUC), with or without the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). Using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), we characterized the responses at 4 and 24 hours after intranasal administration. Within 4 hours, ribosome-associated transcripts decreased in both stromal and immune cells, followed by widespread interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Using RNA velocity, we show that lung-neutrophils dynamically regulate the synthesis of cytokines like CXCL-10, IL-1, and IL-1{beta}. Co-delivery of MPLA and PUUC increased chemokine synthesis and upregulated antimicrobial binding proteins targeting iron, manganese, and zinc in many cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Overall, our results elucidate the early PAMP-induced cellular responses in the lung and demonstrate that stimulation of the RIG-I pathway, with or without TLR4 agonists, induces a ubiquitous microbial defense state in lung stromal and immune cells. Nanoparticle-delivered combination PAMPs may have applications in intranasal antiviral and antimicrobial therapies and prophylaxis."

To address this issue, we performed transcriptional profiling of fission yeast vtc4{Delta} cells, which lack the catalytic subunit of the Vtc4/Vtc2 polyphosphate polymerase complex and thus have no detectable intracellular PolyP. Deleting Vtc4 elicited the de-repression of four protein-coding genes - SPAC186.04c, gdt1/SPAC186.05, SPAC186.06, and SPAC750.01 - located within a sub-telomeric region of the right arm of chromosome I that is known to be transcriptionally silenced by the TORC2 complex. These sub-telomeric genes were equally de-repressed in vtc2{Delta} cells and in cells expressing polymerase-dead Vtc4, signifying that PolyP synthesis is necessary to abet TORC2-dependent locus-specific gene silencing."

To resolve these limitations we have turned to nature, utilising proteins that have evolved over millennia to enable effective energy dissipation. Specifically, a recombinant form of the mechanosensitive protein talin was incorporated into a monomeric unit and crosslinked, resulting in the production of the first reported example of a talin shock absorbing material (TSAM). When subjected to 1.5 km/s supersonic shots, TSAMs were shown not only to absorb the impact, but to capture/preserve the projectile, making TSAMs the first reported protein material to achieve this."

    "abstract": "Monocytes in the blood torrent, when activated by pro-inflammatory signals, adhere to the vascular endothelium and migrate into the tissue for ultimately differentiate into macrophages. Mechanics and adhesion play a crucial role in macrophage functions, such as migration and phagocytosis. However, how monocytes change their adhesion and mechanical properties upon differentiation into macrophages is still not well understood.\n\nIn this work, we combined atomic force microscopy (AFM) viscoelastic mapping with interference contrast microscopy (ICM) to simultaneously probe, at the single-cell level, viscoelasticity and adhesion during monocyte differentiation. THP-1 monocytic cells were differentiated into macrophages through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Morphological quantification was achieved using holographic tomography imaging and the expression of integrin subunit CD11b was tracked as a marker of differentiation.\n\nHolographic tomography proved to be a quantitative in vivo technique, revealing a dramatic increase in macrophage volume and surface area and two subpopulations, spread and round macrophages. AFM viscoelastic mapping revealed an increased stiffness and more solid-like behavior of differentiated macrophages, especially in the lamellipodia and microvilli regions. Differentiated cells revealed an important increase of the apparent Youngs modulus (E0) and a decrease of cell fluidity ({beta}) on differentiated cells, which correlated with an increase in adhesion area. Macrophages with a spreading phenotype enhanced these changes. Remarkably, when adhesion was eliminated, differentiated macrophages remained stiffer and more solid-like than monocytes, suggesting a permanent reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We speculate that the more solid-like microvilli and lamellipodia might help macrophages to minimize energy dissipation during mechanosensitive activity, such as phagocytosis, making it more efficient. Our proposed approach revealed viscoelastic and adhesion hallmarks of monocyte differentiation that may be important for biological function."

We show that NIPBL depletion results in increased cohesin-STAG1 on chromatin that further accumulates at CTCF positions while cohesin-STAG2 diminishes genome-wide. Our data support a model in which NIPBL is not required for initial association of cohesin with chromatin but it is for loop extrusion, which in turn facilitates stabilization of cohesin-STAG2 at CTCF positions after being loaded elsewhere. In contrast, cohesin-STAG1 is loaded and stabilized at CTCF sites even under low NIPBL levels, but genome folding is severely impaired."

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers represent a significant portion of cancer diagnoses, with head and neck cancer incidence increasing in some parts of the world. Typical treatment of early-stage head and neck cancers includes either surgery or radiotherapy; however, advanced cases often require surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Salivary gland damage following radiotherapy leads to severe and chronic hypofunction with decreased salivary output, xerostomia, impaired ability to chew and swallow, increased risk of developing oral mucositis, and malnutrition. There is currently no standard of care for radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction and treatment is often limited to palliative treatment that provides only temporary relief. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that activates catabolic processes and has been shown to influence the cell cycle, proliferation, and autophagy. In the present study, we found that radiation (IR) treatment decreases tissue levels of phosphorylated AMPK following radiation and decreases intracellular NAD+ and AMP while increasing intracellular ATP. Further, expression of Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) were lower five days following IR. Treatment with AMPK activators, AICAR and metformin, attenuated compensatory proliferation (days 6, 7 and 30) following IR, and reversed chronic (day 30) salivary gland dysfunction post-IR. Additionally, treatment with metformin or AICAR increased markers of apical/basolateral polarity (phosphorylated aPKC{zeta}T560 positive area) and differentiation (amylase positive area) within irradiated parotid glands to levels similar to untreated controls. Taken together, these data suggest that AMPK may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of radiation-induced salivary damage."

    "abstract": "There are still large research gaps in the testing standards for non-edible meat-derived components at present. Here we report a novel approach to quantification of adulterated fox-derived components in meat products by drop digital polymerase chain reaction(ddPCR). It was better to identify the adulteration that has been added either inadvertently or deliberately during the process by designing single primers on housekeeping genes. In this paper, the fox meat was used as the experimental materials and the relationship between sample quality and copy number was established by extracting DNA and using DNA concentration as an intermediary. The results of ddPCR showed that both the relationships between meat weight and DNA concentration and between DNA concentration and DNA copy number (C) were nearly linear within the dynamic range. The DNA concentration was utilized as an intermediate value to establish the formulae about the relationship between the original meat weight and DNA copy number: Mfox=0.05C+2.7. The methods feasibility was validated using artificial adulteration of different proportions The establishment of this method provides technical support for relevant regulatory authorities to monitor the adulteration of fox meat."

    "abstract": "WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant defense responses against pathogens. However, no WRKYs have been reported yet in resistance of Nicotiana species to Alternaria alternata, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing brown spot disease. Here, we found that silencing NaWRKY3 lead to wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata highly susceptible to A. alternata. Combination of transcriptome, electrophoretic mobility shift, ChIP-qPCR and dual-LUC analyses, we uncovered that NaWRKY3 bound to many defense genes promoter and activated their expression. Target genes included: 1) lipoxygenases 3, ACC synthase 1 and ACC oxidase 1, three key enzyme genes for JA and ethylene biosynthesis which were critical for A. alternata resistance; 2) feruloyl-CoA 6-hydroxylase 1 (NaF6H1), the key enzyme gene for phytoalexins against A. alternata, scopoletin and scopolin; and 3) three A. alternata resistance genes, long non-coding RNA (LncRNA L2), NADPH oxidase (NaRboh D) and berberine bridge-like (NaBBL28). Silencing LncRNA L2 reduced A. alternata-induced levels of JA and NaF6H1 expression. NaRboh D-silenced plants were strongly impaired in ROS production and stomata closure responses. NaBBL28 was the first A. alternata resistance BBLs identified and was involved in HGL-DTGs hydroxylation. Finally, NaWRKY3 could bind to its own promoter but acted as a transcriptional repressor. Thus we demonstrated that NaWRKY3 is a fine-tuned master regulator of defense network against A. alternata in N. attenuata by regulating different signaling pathways and defense metabolites. For the first time, such an important WRKY was identified in Nicotiana species, providing new insight into defense mechanism of Nicotiana plants to A. alternata."

    "date": "2022-11-29",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "The Myc proto-oncogene contributes to the pathogenesis of more than half of human cancers. Malignant transformation by Myc transcriptionally upregulates the core pre-mRNA splicing machinery and causes mis-regulation of alternative splicing. However, our understanding of how splicing changes are directed by Myc is limited. We performed a signaling pathway-guided splicing analysis to identify Myc dependent splicing events. These included an HRAS cassette exon repressed by Myc across multiple tumor types. To molecularly dissect the regulation of this HRAS exon, we used antisense oligonucleotide tiling to identify splicing enhancers and silencers in its flanking introns. RNA binding motif prediction indicated multiple binding sites for hnRNP H and hnRNP F within these cis-regulatory elements. Using siRNA knockdown and cDNA expression, we found that both hnRNP H and F activate the HRAS cassette exon.\n\nMutagenesis and targeted RNA immunoprecipitation implicate two downstream G-rich elements in this splicing activation. Analyses of ENCODE RNA-seq datasets confirmed hnRNP H regulation of HRAS splicing. Analyses of RNA-seq datasets across multiple cancers showed a negative correlation of hnRNP H gene expression with Myc hallmark enrichment, consistent with the effect of hnRNP H on HRAS splicing. Interestingly, hnRNP F expression showed a positive correlation with Myc hallmarks and thus was not consistent with the observed effects of hnRNP F. Loss of hnRNP H/F altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Collectively, our results reveal new mechanisms for Myc-dependent regulation of splicing, and point to new possible therapeutic targets in prostate cancers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATMENTMyc Transformation by the proto-oncogene c-Myc causes dysregulation of the pre-mRNA splicing reaction in cancer, but it is not known how mRNA isoform changes are directed by Myc. Here, we use bioinformatics to identify a splicing event in another proto-oncogene, HRAS, that is regulated by Myc across multiple tumor types. We identify new splicing regulators, hnRNPs H and F, that control this HRAS exon by binding to enhancer elements within its downstream intron. Additional pan-cancer bioinformatic analyses show hnRNP H expression to be anti- correlated with Myc hallmarks, consistent with the reduced splicing of the HRAS exon in Myc driven cancer. These findings uncover new mechanisms by which Myc can alter splicing in cancer cells and provide new molecular targets for potential therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Replication stress has been suggested to be an ultimate trigger of carcinogenesis. Oncogenic signal, such as overexpression of CyclinE, has been shown to induce replication stress. Here, we show that various biological stresses, including heat, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, LPS, hypoxia, and arsenate induce activation of Chk1, a key effector kinase for replication checkpoint. Some of these stresses indeed reduce the fork rate, inhibiting DNA replication. Analyses of Chk1 activation in the cell population with western analyses showed that Chk1 activation by these stresses is largely dependent on Claspin. On the other hand, single cell analyses with Fucci cells indicated that while Chk1 activation during S phase is dependent on Claspin, that in G1 is mostly independent of Claspin. We propose that various biological stresses activate Chk1 either directly by stalling DNA replication fork or by some other mechanism that does not involve replication inhibition. The former pathway predominantly occurs in S phase and depends on Claspin, while the latter pathway, which may occur throughout the cell cycle, is largely independent of Claspin.\n\nOur findings provide evidence for novel links between replication stress checkpoint and other biological stresses and points to the presence of unknown mechanisms of Chk1 activation in mammalian cells."

    "abstract": "Synthetic genetic circuits enable precise and dynamic control of gene expression, making them useful tools in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for regulating cellular responses under transient states, such as metabolic flux and stress. However, the complexity and utility of these systems are restricted by the limited set of available regulatory parts. To engineer circuits with desirable levels of programmable control, these components must be orthogonal from the host expression systems. Bacterial sigma factors and RNA polymerases are ideal targets for synthetic regulation, as they represent the first level of transcriptional control and modulate gene expression in endogenous systems. While attempts have been made to engineer orthogonality through heterologous sigmas, a lack of diversity in consensus promoter sequences and toxicity often limit the utility of these sigmas. In this work, we leverage computational design and high-throughput screening to engineer {sigma}70 bacterial transcription factors capable of targeting any promoter sequence to maximize orthogonality. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we engineered several {sigma}70 variants, each capable of targeting one of five different orthogonal promoter sequences, leading to the expression of a downstream reporter gene. By engineering these sigma variants, we present a generalized workflow capable to produce orthogonal sigma factors that may serve as a vital tool in the design of customizable synthetic genetic circuits."

However, the mechanistic details that describe the large-scale conformational changes associated with spike protein activation or deactivation are still somewhat unknown. Here, we have employed an extensive set of nonequilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, utilizing a novel protocol, for the SARS-CoV-1 (CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) prefusion spike proteins in order to characterize the conformational pathways associated with the active-to-inactive transition. Our results indicate that both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins undergo conformational transitions along pathways unique to each protein. We have identified a number of key residues that form various inter-domain saltbridges, suggesting a multi-stage conformational change along the pathways. We have also constructed the free energy profiles along the transition pathways for both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. The CoV-2 spike protein must overcome larger free energy barriers to undergo conformational changes towards protein activation or deactivation, when compared to CoV-1."

These FRET pairs enabled the straightforward design of biosensors for calcium, ATP and NAD+ with unprecedented dynamic ranges. The color of each of these biosensors can be readily tuned by either changing the fluorescent protein or the synthetic fluorophore, which enabled to monitor simultaneously free NAD+ in different subcellular compartments upon genotoxic stress. Minimal modifications furthermore allow the readout of these biosensors to be switched to fluorescence intensity, lifetime or bioluminescence. These FRET pairs thus establish a new concept for the development of highly sensitive and tunable biosensors.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518186v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10083c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ca6d76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d87d28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d432_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles, the membrane of which fuses with the plasma membrane upon calcium influx. This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane SNARE proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different critical positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1. In the future, research should investigate how this central reaction for neuronal communication is controlled by other proteins."

    "abstract": "MotivationThere is widespread interest in identifying genetic variants that exhibit parent-of-origin effects (POEs) wherein the effect of an allele on phenotype expression depends on its parental origin. POEs can arise from different phenomena including genomic imprinting and have been documented for many complex traits. Traditional tests for POEs require family data to determine parental origins of transmitted alleles. As most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) instead sample unrelated individuals (where allelic parental origin is unknown), the study of POEs in such datasets requires sophisticated statistical methods that exploit genetic patterns we anticipate observing when POEs exist. We propose a method to improve discovery of POE variants in large-scale GWAS samples that leverages potential pleiotropy among multiple correlated traits often collected in such studies. Our method compares the phenotypic covariance matrix of heterozygotes to homozygotes based on a Robust Omnibus Test. We refer to our method as the Parent of Origin Inference using Robust Omnibus Test (POIROT) of multiple quantitative traits.\n\nResultsThrough simulation studies, we compared POIROT to a competing univariate variance-based method which considers separate analysis of each phenotype. We observed POIROT to be well-calibrated with improved power to detect POEs compared to univariate methods. POIROT is robust to non-normality of phenotypes and can easily adjust for population stratification and other confounders. Finally, we applied POIROT to a GWAS of quantitative anthropometric measures at birth. We identified two loci of suggestive significance for follow-up investigation."

Pre-trained molecular representation based on retrosynthesis prediction model (PMRRP) was trained from 501 inhibitors of 55 proteins and successfully predicted the koff values of 38 inhibitors for HSP90 protein from an independent dataset. Our PMRRP molecular representation outperforms others such as GEM, MPG, and common molecular descriptors from RDKit. Furthermore, we optimized the accelerated molecular dynamics to calculate relative retention times for 128 inhibitors of HSP90. We observed high correlation between the simulated, predicted, and experimental -log(koff) scores. Combining machine learning (ML) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation help design a drug with specific selectivity to the target of interest. Protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs) derived from accelerated MD further expedite the design of new drugs with the desired kinetic properties. To further validate our koff ML model, from the set of potential HSP90 inhibitors obtained by similarity search of commercial databases, we identified two novel molecules with better predicted koff values and longer simulated retention time than the reference molecules. The IFPs of the novel molecules with the newly discovered interacting residues along the dissociation pathways of HSP90 shed light on the nature of the selectivity of HSP90 protein. We believe the ML model described here is transferable to predict koff of other proteins and enhance the kinetics-based drug design endeavor."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "The application of B-cell epitope identification for the development of therapeutic antibodies is well established but consuming in terms of time and resources. For this reason, in the last few years, the immunoinformatic community has developed several computational predictive tools.\n\nWhile relatively successful, most of these tools only use a few properties of the candidate region to determine their likelihood of being a true B-cell epitope. However, this likelihood is influenced by a wide variety of protein features, including the presence of glycosylated residues in the neighbourhood of the candidate epitope, the subcellular location of the protein region or the three-dimensional information about their surface accessibility in the parental protein.\n\nIn this study we created Brewpitopes, an integrative pipeline to curate computational predictions of B-cell epitopes by accounting for all the aforementioned features. To this end, we implemented a set of rational filters to mimic the conditions for the in vivo antibody recognition to enrich the B-cell epitope predictions in actionable candidates. To validate Brewpitopes, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. In the S protein, Brewpitopes enriched the initial predictions in 5-fold on epitopes with neutralizing potential (p-value < 2e-4). Other than S protein, 4 out of 16 proteins in the proteome contain curated B-cell epitopes and hence, have also potential interest for viral neutralization, since mutational escape mainly affects the S protein. Our results demonstrate that Brewpitopes is a powerful pipeline for the rapid prediction of refined B-cell epitopes during public health emergencies.\n\nStatement of significanceWe have created Brewpitopes, a new pipeline that integrates additional important features such as glycosylation or structural accessibility, to curate B-cell epitope more likely to be functional in vivo. We have also validated Brewpitopes against SARS-CoV-2 not only for S protein but also for the entire viral proteome demonstrating that is a rapid and reliable epitope predictive tool to be implemented in present or future public health emergencies. Brewpitopes has identified 7 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in S and epitopes allocated in 4 other proteins. Overall, offering an accurate selection of epitopes that might be scaled up to the production of new antibodies."

    "abstract": "The foreign body response to implanted materials often complicates the functionality of sensitive biomedical devices. For cochlear implants, this response can reduce device performance, battery life and preservation of residual acoustic hearing. As a permanent and passive solution to the foreign body response, this work investigates ultra-low-fouling poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA) thin film hydrogels that are simultaneously photo-grafted and photo-polymerized onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The cellular anti-fouling properties of these coatings are robustly maintained even after six-months subcutaneous incubation and over a broad range of cross-linker compositions. On pCBMA-coated PDMS sheets implanted subcutaneously, capsule thickness and inflammation are reduced significantly in comparison to uncoated PDMS or coatings of polymerized poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (pPEGDMA) or poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA). Further, capsule thickness is reduced over a wide range of pCBMA cross-linker compositions. On cochlear implant electrode arrays implanted subcutaneously for one year, the coating bridges over the exposed platinum electrodes and dramatically reduces the capsule thickness over the entire implant. Coated cochlear implant electrode arrays could therefore lead to persistent improved performance and reduced risk of residual hearing loss. More generally, the in vivo anti-fibrotic properties of pCBMA coatings also demonstrate potential to mitigate the fibrotic response on a variety of sensing/stimulating implants.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518125v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@331bdeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16abb1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@223b61org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16869a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Individual pain sensitivity is influenced by many factors, such as the differentiation of brain regional features and genetic variations. However, its heritability remains largely unclear. The present study conducted a brain-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic bases of structural and functional neuroimage phenotypes of pain sensitivity. In total 432 normal participants were firstly divided into high and low pain sensitivity groups according to laser quantitative test threshold and related brain regions gray matter density (GMD) features were identified. Consequently, GWAS was performed on each GMD phenotype using quality-controlled genotypes. Based on the heatmap and hierarchical clustering results from GWAS, the right insula was selected for further refined analysis in terms of sub-regions GMD and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) phenotypes. The results indicate that the right insula GMD in the high sensitivity group is significantly lower than the low sensitivity group. Also, the TT/TC group at locus rs187974 may lead to a lower GMD in the right insula than the CC group. Meanwhile, loci at gene CYP2D6 may lead to a variation of rs-FC between the right insula and left putamen. In conclusion, our study suggests multiple candidate loci associated with pain sensitivity that may influence brain phenotypes."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Modifications of histones are intricately linked with the regulation of gene expression, with demonstrated roles in various physiological processes and disease pathogenesis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), implemented by the COMPASS family, is enriched at promoters and associated cis-regulatory elements, with H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) considered a hallmark of active gene promoters. However, the relative roles of deposition and removal of H3K4 methylation, as well as the extent to which these events contribute to transcriptional regulation have so far remained unclear. Here, through rapid depletion of the transcription regulator SPT5 or either of two shared subunits of COMPASS family members, we reveal a dynamic turnover of H3K4me3 mediated by the KDM5 family of histone demethylases. Loss of H3K4me3 following COMPASS disruption does not impair the recruitment of TFIID and initiating RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Instead, H3K4me3 loss leads to reductions in the paused form of Pol II on chromatin while inducing the relative enrichment of the Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) termination complex, leading to reduced levels of elongating polymerases, thus revealing how H3K4me3 dynamics can regulate Pol II pausing to sustain or attenuate transcription."

Our model, which can be applied to both Illumina 450k and EPIC microarrays, explained a larger proportion of the observed variance in whole blood DNA methylation levels than popular reference-based cell deconvolution approaches, and vastly reduced the number of false-positive findings in a reanalysis of an epigenome-wide association study of chronological age."

The release of whole genome sequencing data for 150,119 UK Biobank (UKB) samples represents an unprecedented opportunity to impute lcWGS with high accuracy. However, despite recent progress1,2, current methods struggle to cope with the growing numbers of samples and markers in modern reference panels, resulting in unsustainable computational costs. For instance, the imputation cost for a single genome is 1.11{pound} using GLIMPSE v1.1.1 (GLIMPSE1) on the UKB research analysis platform (RAP) and rises to 242.8{pound} using QUILT v1.0.4. To overcome this computational burden, we introduce GLIMPSE v2.0.0 (GLIMPSE2), a major improvement of GLIMPSE, that scales sublinearly in both the number of samples and markers. GLIMPSE2 imputes a low-coverage genome from the UKB reference panel for only 0.08{pound} in compute cost while retaining high accuracy for both ancient and modern genomes, particularly at rare variants (MAF < 0.1%) and for very low-coverage samples (0.1x-0.5x)."

Modern techniques achieve this goal by comparing microbial genetic material against reference databases of functionally annotated genes/proteins or known taxonomic markers such as 16S rRNA. Here we describe a novel approach to exploring bacterial functional repertoires without reference databases. Our Fusion scheme establishes functional relationships between bacteria and thus assigns organisms to Fusion taxa that differ from otherwise defined taxonomic clades. Three key findings of our work stand out. First, Fusion profile comparisons outperform existing functional annotation schemes in recovering taxonomic labels. Second, Fusion-derived functional co-occurrence profiles reflect known metabolic pathways, suggesting a route for discovery of new ones. Finally, our alignment-free nucleic acid-based Siamese Neural Network model, trained using Fusion functions, enables finding shared functionality of very distant, possibly structurally different, microbial homologs. Our work can thus help annotate functional repertoires of bacterial organisms and further guide our understanding of microbial communities."

Genomic annotation tools have revolutionized gene prediction and metabolic reconstruction, and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. Despite these advancements, there is no hierarchical pipeline to prioritize the annotation of certain valuable ortholog identifiers and enzyme commission numbers. Such data can be introduced in many tools for metabolic analysis, but currently their annotation is hindered by inaccurate workflows and meaningless information retrieval. This is true especially for those annotators based on very small or too-large protein databases. In this study, we provide a solution based on a hierarchical methodology and optimized databases which additionally overcome data download challenges. The herein presented software framework demonstrates highly optimized and accurate results, and provides an analysis pipeline that can accommodate different search algorithms across prokaryotic genomes, and metagenomes."

However, bulky and rigid electrodes used currently in clinics are usually unable to reliably maintain continuous and stable contacts with the vulnerable and complex nerve networks, thus often resulting in detrimental post-operative complications, such as hemiplegia and sensory disturbances. Here, we describe a biomechanically compatible, suture-free, and individually reconfigurable CINM based on soft and stretchable organic electronic materials. Due to both low impedance and modulus of our conducting polymer electrodes, we achieved for the first time continuous recording of near-field action potential with high signal-to-noise ratio and minimal invasiveness during microsurgeries. Utilizing this unprecedented CINM modality, in conjunction with localized neurostimulation, we further demonstrated our approach in enabling optimal post-operative prognosis in preclinical animal models by preserving normal neural functions after a variety of tumor resection surgeries."

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms play an essential role in many biological processes and surprisingly only three prokaryotic proteins are required to constitute a true post-translational circadian oscillator. The evolutionary history of the three Kai proteins indicates that KaiC is the oldest member and central component of the clock, with subsequent additions of KaiB and KaiA to regulate its phosphorylation state for time synchronization. The canonical KaiABC system in cyanobacteria is well understood, but little is known about more ancient systems that possess just KaiBC, except for reports that they might exhibit a basic, hourglass-like timekeeping mechanism. Here, we investigate the primordial circadian clock in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RS) that contains only KaiBC to elucidate its inner workings despite the missing KaiA. Using a combination X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM we find a novel dodecameric fold for KaiCRS where two hexamers are held together by a coiled-coil bundle of 12 helices. This interaction is formed by the C-terminal extension of KaiCRS and serves as an ancient regulatory moiety later superseded by KaiA. A coiled-coil register shift between daytime- and nighttime-conformations is connected to the phosphorylation sites through a long-range allosteric network that spans over 160 [A]. Our kinetic data identify the difference in ATP-to-ADP ratio between day and night as the environmental cue that drives the clock and further unravels mechanistic details that shed light on the evolution of self-sustained oscillators."

Traditional approaches to DNA damage analysis provide minimal insights into the spectrum of disease- driving DNA lesions and the mechanisms causing imbalances in damage formation and repair.

As evidence of methodologic rigor, 10 selected adductomic signals were structurally validated as epigenetic marks: 5-MdC, 5-HMdC, 5-FdC; DNA damage products: N2-CMdG, 1,N6-{varepsilon}dA, 3,N4-{varepsilon}dC, M1dG, O6/N2- MdG, and 8-Oxo-dG; and established analytical artifacts: cyclobutane dimers of 2- deoxycytosine. With steady-state levels of putative DNA adducts integrating multiple cell types in each tissue, there was strong age-dependent variation for many putative adducts, including N2-CMdG, 5-HMdC, and 8-Oxo-dG in rats and 1,N6-{varepsilon}dA in human heart, as well as sex biases for 67 putative adducts in rat tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of untargeted adductomic analysis for defining DNA adducts as disease determinants, assigning substrates to DNA repair pathways, discovering new metabolically-driven DNA lesions, and quantifying inter-individual variation in DNA damage and repair across populations."

We examined three nuclear-phased genome assemblies of Puccinia triticina, which causes wheat leaf rust disease. We found that the most recently emerged Australian lineage is derived by nuclear exchange between two pre-existing lineages, which originated in Europe and North America. Haplotype-specific phylogenetic analysis reveal that repeated somatic exchange events have shuffled haploid nuclei between long-term clonal lineages, leading to a global population representing different combinations of a limited number of haploid genomes. Thus, nuclear exchange seems to be the predominant mechanism generating diversity and the emergence of new strains in this otherwise clonal pathogen. Such genomics-accelerated surveillance of pathogen evolution paves the way for more accurate global disease monitoring."

We then tested ProtLM.TCR on a balanced set of binders and non-binders for each epitope, avoiding model shortcuts like HLA categories. We compared pan-HLA versus HLA-specific models, and our results show that while computational prediction of novel TCR-epitope binding probability is feasible, more epitopes and diverse training datasets are required to achieve a better generalized performances in de novo epitope binding prediction tasks. We also show that ProtLM.TCR embeddings outperform BLOSUM scores and hand-crafted embeddings. Finally, we have used the LIME framework to examine the interpretability of these predictions."

    "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa is a gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium that caused a significant economic impact around the world. In the last decade, genome-scale metabolic models have become important systems biology tools for studying the metabolic behaviour of different pathogens and driving the discovery of novel drug targets. In this work, a GSM model of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca De Donno was developed. The model comprises 1164 reactions, 1379 metabolites, and 508 genes. in silico validation of the metabolic model was achieved through the comparison of simulations with available experimental data. Aerobic metabolism was simulated properly and fastidian gum production rates predicted accurately. The GSM model allowed identifying potential drug targets, using a pipeline based on the models gene essentially analysis."

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanical demands of an exercise on the musculoskeletal system is crucial to prescribe effective training or therapeutic interventions. Yet, that knowledge is currently limited in water, mostly because of the difficulty in evaluating external resistance. Here I reconcile recent advances in 3D markerless pose and mesh estimation, biomechanical simulations, and hydrodynamic modeling, to predict lower limb mechanical loading during aquatic exercises. Simulations are driven exclusively from a single video. In silico hip and knee joint forces agreed well with in vivo instrumented implant recordings downloaded from the OrthoLoad database, both in magnitude and direction. New insights into individual muscle contributions to joint loading were gained. This noninvasive method has the potential to standardize the reporting of exercise intensity, inform the design of rehabilitation protocols and improve their reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Sapindaceae is a family of flowering plants, also known as the soapberry family, comprising 141 genera and about 1900 species (Pedro et al., 2010). Most of them are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, including trees, shrubs, also woody or herbaceous vines. Some are dioecious, while others are monoecious. Many Sapindaceae species possess great economic value; some furnish delicious fruits, like lychee (Litchi chinensis), longan (Dimocarpus longan), rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum); and ackee (Blighia sapida) - the national fruit of Jamaica; some produce abundance secondary metabolites, like saponin from soapberry (Sapindus mukorossi), and seed oil from yellowhorn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium); some yield valuable timber including maple (Acer spp.) and buckeye (Aesculus glabra); and some are of great herbal medicinal value, like balloon-vine (Cardiospermum halicacabum).\n\nIn the last decade, with the rocketing of next generation sequencing (NGS) and genomic technologies, the full genome sequences of several Sapindaceae plants have been resolved (Lin et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022). Among them, our recent publication of the lychee genome attracted broad attention (Edger, 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Lyu, 2022). Now the post-genome era arrives for Sapindaceae, however, there is no public genomic database available for any Sapindaceae species, let alone an integrative database for the whole Sapindaceae family. A unified data platform is in urgent need to collect, manage and share relevant data resources. Therefore, we integrated our home-brew NGS data with all publicly available data for seven Sapindaceae plants and constructed the Sapinaceae Genomic DataBase, named SapBase (www.sapindaceae.com), in order to provide genomic resources and an online powerful analytic platform for scientific research on Sapinaceae species and comparative studies with other plants."

    "abstract": "The inverse of the genomic relationship matrix (G-1) is used in the single-step genomic BLUP, which incorporates genomic, pedigree, and phenotype information for simultaneous genetic evaluation of genotyped and non-genotyped individuals. The rapidly growing number of genotypes is a constraint for inverting a huge G. The APY algorithm is an efficient method of solving this issue. Matrix G has a limited dimensionality. Dividing individuals into core and non-core, G-1 is approximated via the inverse partition of G for core individuals. The quality of the approximation depends on the core size and composition. The APY algorithm conditions genomic breeding values of the non-core individuals to those of the core individuals, leading to a diagonal block of G-1 for non-core individuals [Formula]. Dividing observations into two groups (e.g., core and non-core, or genotyped and non-genotyped), any symmetric matrix can be expressed in APY and APY inverse expressions, equal to the matrix itself and its inverse, respectively. The change of Gnn to [Formula] makes APY an approximate. The application of APY is extendable to the inversion of any large symmetric matrix with a limited dimensionality at a lower computational cost. Possible applications are: computing the pedigree relationship matrix (A) from the APY inverse of A-1, a diagonal block of A (same as the previous one, but avoiding unnecessary calculations), and the block of the block-diagonal preconditioner matrix corresponding to marker effects for iterative solving of marker effect model equations. Furthermore, APY may improve the matrixs numerical condition."

    "abstract": "Under homeostatic conditions, esophageal epithelium displays a proliferation/differentiation gradient that is generated as proliferative basal cells give rise to suprabasal cells then terminally differentiated superficial cells. This proliferation/differentiation gradient is perturbed in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Esophageal cancer is among the deadliest forms of human malignancy with 5-year survival rates of <20%. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are the two most common subtypes of esophageal cancer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a primary risk factor for EAC. Although GERD and the food allergy-mediated condition eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are both associated with chronic esophageal inflammation and epithelial remodeling, including basal cell hyperplasia, epidemiological evidence suggests that EoE patients do not develop esophageal malignancy. Here, we perform single cell RNA-sequencing in murine models of EoE and ESCC to delineate the effects that these two conditions have specifically upon the cellular landscape of esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE or ESCC, we find expansion of cell populations as compared to normal esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE, we detect expansion of 4 suprabasal populations coupled with depletion of 4 basal cell populations. By contrast, mice with ESCC display expansion of 4 basal populations as well as depletion of 3 superficial populations. We further evaluated modules of co-expressed genes in EoE- and ESCC-enriched epithelial cell clusters. Senescence, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor pathways were associated with EoE-enriched clusters while pathways associated with cell proliferation and metabolism were identified in ESCC-enriched clusters. Finally, by pairing murine models of EoE and ESCC, we demonstrate that exposure to EoE inflammation limits esophageal carcinogenesis. Our findings provide the first functional investigation of the relationship between EoE and esophageal cancer and suggest that esophageal epithelial remodeling events occurring in response to EoE inflammation may limit act to esophageal carcinogenesis which may have future implications for leveraging allergic inflammation-associated alterations in epithelial biology to prevent and/or treat esophageal cancer."

    "abstract": "Allostery, the tranfer of information between distant parts of a macromolecule, is a fundamental feature of protein function and regulation. However, allosteric mechanisms are usually not explained by protein structure, requiring information on correlated fluctuations uniquely accessible to molecular simulation. Existing work to extract allosteric pathways from molecular dynamics simulations has focused on thermodynamic correlations. Here we show how kinetic correlations (i.e. dynamical activity) encode complementary information essential to explain observed variations in allosteric regulation. We performed atomistic simulations, totalling 0.5 milliseconds, on H, K, and NRas isoforms in the apo, GTP, and GDP-bound states of Ras protein, with and without complexing to its downstream effector, Raf. We show that differences in experimentally measured intrinsic and Raf-dependent catalytic speed amongst the three isoforms can be explained by dynamical activity and entropy, respectively. We show that Switch I and Switch II are the primary components of thermodynamic and kinetic allosteric networks, consistent with the key roles of these two motifs. These communication networks are altered by the hydrolysis of the substrate gamma phosphate, leading to increased entropy in HRas loops involved in substrate release. We find that the putative allosteric region is not coupled in KRas, but is coupled to the hydrolysis arm switch II in NRas and HRas, and that the mechanism in the latter two isoforms are thermodynamic and kinetic, respectively. Binding of Raf-RBD further activates thermodynamic allostery in HRas and KRas but has limited effect on NRas. These results indicate that kinetic and thermodynamic correlations are both needed to explain protein function and allostery. These two distinct channels of allosteric regulation, and their combinatorial variability, may explain how subtle mutational differences can lead to diverse regulatory profiles among enzymatic proteins."

    "abstract": "The increasing generation of population-level single-cell atlases with hundreds or thousands of samples has the potential to link demographic and technical metadata with high-resolution cellular and tissue data in homeostasis and disease. Constructing such comprehensive references requires large-scale integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata capturing demographic and technical information. Here, we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), a semi-supervised conditional deep generative model for data integration, label transfer and query-to-reference mapping. Unlike other models, scPoli learns both sample and cell representations, is aware of cell-type annotations and can integrate and annotate newly generated query datasets while providing an uncertainty mechanism to identify unknown populations. We extensively evaluated the method and showed its advantages over existing approaches. We applied scPoli to two population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the latter consisting of roughly 8 million cells across 2,375 samples. We demonstrate that scPoli allows atlas-level integration and automatic reference mapping with label transfer. It can explain sample-level biological and technical variations such as disease, anatomical location and assay by means of its novel sample embeddings. We use these embeddings to explore sample-level metadata, enable automatic sample classification and guide a data integration workflow. scPoli also enables simultaneous sample-level and cell-level analysis of gene expression patterns, revealing genes associated with batch effects and the main axes of between-sample variation. We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses."

    "date": "2022-11-29",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are commonly used to identify genomic variants that are associated with complex traits, and estimate the magnitude of this association for each variant. However, it has been widely observed that the association estimates of variants tend to be lower in a replication study than in the study that discovered those associations. A phenomenon known as Winners Curse is responsible for this upward bias present in association estimates of significant variants in the discovery study. We review existing Winners Curse correction methods which require only GWAS summary statistics in order to make adjustments. In addition, we propose modifications to improve existing methods and propose a novel approach which uses the parametric bootstrap. We evaluate and compare methods, first using a wide variety of simulated data sets and then, using real data sets for three different traits. The metric, estimated mean squared error (MSE) over significant SNPs, was primarily used for method assessment. Our results indicate that widely used conditional likelihood based methods tend to perform poorly. The other considered methods behave much more similarly, with our proposed bootstrap method demonstrating very competitive performance. To complement this review, we have developed an R package,  winnerscurse which can be used to implement these various Winners Curse adjustment methods to GWAS summary statistics.\n\nAuthor SummaryA genome-wide association study is designed to analyse many common genetic variants in thousands of samples and identify which variants are associated with a trait of interest. It provides estimates of association strength for each variant and variants are classified as associated if their test statistics obtained in the study pass a chosen significance threshold. However, due to a phenomenon known as Winners Curse, the association estimates of these significant variants tend to be upward biased and greater in magnitude than their true values. Naturally, this bias has adverse consequences for downstream statistical techniques which use these estimates. In this paper, we look at current methods which have been designed to combat Winners Curse and propose modifications to these methods in order to improve performance. Using a wide variety of simulated data sets as well as real data, we perform a thorough evaluation of these methods. We use a metric which allows us to identify which methods, on average, produce adjusted estimates for significant variants that are closest to the true values. To accompany our work, we have created an R package,  winnerscurse, which allows users to easily apply Winners Curse correction methods to their data sets."

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEndoC-{beta}H5 is a newly established human beta-cell model which may be superior to previous models of native human beta cells. Exposure of beta cells to proinflammatory cytokines is a widely used in vitro model of immune-mediated beta-cell failure in type 1 diabetes and we therefore performed an in-depth characterisation of the effects of cytokines on EndoC-{beta}H5 cells.\n\nMethodsThe sensitivity profile of EndoC-{beta}H5 cells to the toxic effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF) was examined in titration and time-course experiments. Cell death was evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity, cytotoxicity, viability, TUNEL assay and immunoblotting. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by extracellular flux technology. Activation of signalling pathways and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression were examined by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and cytokine-induced chemokine secretion were measured by ELISA and Meso Scale Discovery multiplexing electrochemiluminescence, respectively. Global gene expression was characterised by stranded RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsCytokines increased caspase activity and cytotoxicity in EndoC-{beta}H5 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The proapoptotic effect of cytokines was primarily driven by IFN{gamma}. Cytokine exposure caused impaired mitochondrial function, diminished GSIS, and induced secretion of chemokines. At the signalling level, cytokines increased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) but not c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and did not cause degradation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor  (I{kappa}B). MHC class I was induced by cytokines. Cytokine exposure caused significant changes to the EndoC-{beta}H5 transcriptome including upregulation of HLA genes, endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and non-coding RNAs. Among the differentially expressed genes were several type 1 diabetes risk genes.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides detailed insight into the functional and transcriptomic effects of cytokines on EndoC-{beta}H5 cells. This knowledge will be helpful for future investigations studying cytokine effects in this cell model."

Here we report an unexpected, and mechanistically distinct, nuclear function of iRhoms. iRhom2 is a non-canonical substrate of the signal peptidase complex (SPC), the protease that removes signal peptides from secreted proteins. Cleavage of iRhom2 generates an N-terminal fragment that enters the nucleus and modifies the cellular transcriptome. We observed elevated nuclear iRhom2 in skin biopsies of patients with psoriasis and tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC); increased SPC-mediated iRhom2 cleavage in a psoriasis model; and overlapping transcriptional signatures between psoriasis and expression of the iRhom2 N-terminus. This work highlights the pathophysiological significance of this SPC-dependent ER-to-nucleus signalling pathway, and is the first example of a rhomboid-like protein that mediates protease-regulated nuclear signalling."

We developed an artery-on-a-chip with the objective to recapitulate the structure of the arterial wall composed of intimal and medial layers and the relevant hemodynamic forces that affect luminal cells.\n\nResultsBy comparing arteries-on-chips exposed either to in vivo-like shear stress values or kept in static conditions, we identified a panel of novel genes modulated by shear stress. We next measured the expression pattern of shear stress-modulated_genes in areas of the vascular tree affected by atherosclerotic plaques and aortic aneurysms, where disease development and progression are induced by alterations of shear stress. We obtained biopsies from patients affected by carotid artery disease (CAD), comprising the atherosclerotic plaque (diseased artery) and the adjacent region (non-diseased artery). From patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), we obtained the aneurysmal portion (diseased aorta) and non-dilated adjacent segment (non-diseased aorta). Genes modulated by shear stress followed the same expression pattern in non-diseased segments of human vessels and were expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence analysis and single cell RNA sequencing. Using mice and porcine models of vascular CAD and AAA, we confirmed that shear stress mediated targets are important in discriminating diseased and non-diseased vessel portions in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that our artery-on-a-chip can serve as a platform for drug-testing. We were able to reproduce the effects of a therapeutic agent previously used in AAA animal models in artery-on-a-chip systems and extend our understanding of its therapeutic effect through a multicellular structure.\n\nConclusionsOur novel in vitro model is capable of mimicking important physiological aspects of human arteries, such as the response to shear stress, and can further shed light on the mechanism of action of potential therapeutics before they enter the clinical stage.\n\nTeaserThe artery-on-a-chip is a novel in vitro platform that enables the mimicry of human arteries and can be used to gain insights into the development and therapeutic targeting of vascular diseases."

    "date": "2022-11-29",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "In human sperm, head spinning is essential for sperm swimming and critical for fertilization. Measurement of head spinning has not been straightforward due to its symmetric head morphology, its translucent nature and fast 3D motion driven by its helical flagellum movement. Microscope image acquisition has been mostly restricted to 2D single focal plane images limited to head position tracing, in absence of head orientation and rotation in 3D. To date, human sperm spinning has been reported to be mono or bidirectional, and even intermittently changing direction. This variety in head spinning direction, however, appears to contradict observations of conserved helical beating of the human sperm flagellum. Here, we reconcile these observations by directly measuring the head spinning movement of freely swimming human sperm with multi-plane 4D microscopy. We show that 2D microscopy is unable to distinguish the spinning direction in human sperm. We evaluated the head spinning of 409 spermatozoa in four different conditions: in non-capacitating and capacitating solutions, for both aqueous and viscous media. All spinning spermatozoa, regardless of the experimental conditions spun counterclockwise (CCW) as seen from head-to-tail. Head spinning was suppressed in 57% of spermatozoa swimming in non-capacitating viscous media, though, interestingly, they recovered the CCW spinning after incubation in capacitating conditions within the same viscous medium. Our observations show that the spinning direction in human sperm is conserved, even when recovered from non-spin, indicating the presence of a robust and persistent helical driving mechanism powering the human sperm flagellum, thus of critical importance in future sperm motility assessments, human reproduction research and microorganism self-organised swimming."

    "abstract": "RationaleAortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a major contributor to cardiovascular death in the elderly population worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly dysregulated in patients with AVS undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, miRNA-dependent mechanisms regulating inflammation and calcification or miRNA-mediated cell-cell crossstalk during the pathogenesis of AVS are still poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of extracellular vesicles (EV)-associated miR-145-5p, which we showed to be highly upregulated upon valvular calcification in AVS in mice and humans.\n\nMethodsHuman TaqMan miRNA arrays identified dysregulated miRNAs in aortic valve tissue explants from AVS patients compared to non-calcified valvular tissue explants of patients undergoing SAVR. Echocardiographic parameters were measured in association with the quantification of dysregulated miRNAs in a murine AVS model. In vitro calcification experiments were performed to explore the effects of EV-miR-145-5p on calcification and crosstalk in valvular cells. To dissect molecular miRNA signatures and their effect on signaling pathways, integrated OMICS analyses were performed. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), high-throughput transcription factor (TF) and proteome arrays showed that a number of genes, miRNAs, TFs, and proteins are crucial for calcification and apoptosis, which are involved in the pathogenesis of AVS.\n\nResultsAmong several miRNAs dysregulated in valve explants of AVS patients, miR-145-5p was the most highly gender-independently dysregulated miRNA (AUC, 0.780, p-value, 0.01). MiRNA arrays utilizing patient-derived- and murine aortic-stenosis samples demonstrated that the expression of miR-145-5p is significantly upregulated and correlates positively with cardiac function based on echocardiography. In vitro experiments confirmed that miR-145-5p is encapsulated into EVs and shuttled into valvular interstitial cells. Based on the integrated OMICs results, miR-145-5p interrelates with markers of inflammation, calcification, and apoptosis. In vitro calcification experiments demonstrated that miR-145-5p regulates the ALPL gene, a hallmark of calcification in vascular and valvular cells. EV-mediated shuttling of miR-145-5p suppressed the expression of ZEB2, a negative regulator of the ALPL gene, by binding to its 3 untranslated region to inhibit its translation, thereby diminishing the calcification of target valvular interstitial cells.\n\nConclusionElevated levels of pro-calcific and pro-apoptotic EV-associated miR-145-5p contribute to the progression of AVS via the ZEB2-ALPL axis, which could potentially be therapeutically targeted to minimize the burden of AVS.\n\nClinical SignificanceO_ST_ABSWhat is known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most prevalent structural heart valve disease requiring surgical or interventional valve replacement. Currently, no medical treatment option is available to slow, halt, or reverse the progression of the disease.\nC_LIO_LIAVS induces pressure overload on the left ventricle (LV), resulting in concentric hypertrophy and LV dysfunction.\nC_LIO_LIAVS is not an exclusively degenerative disease that leads to fibrosis and calcification of the valve cusps but rather a chronic inflammatory disease, in which mechanical strain and shear stress lead to endothelial dysfunction and immune cell infiltration, which induces chronic inflammation, apoptosis and differentiation of valvular interstitial cells into osteoblast-like cells.\nC_LIO_LIIncreasing osteoblastic differentiation and the formation of macrocalcifications are hallmarks of the later stages of AVS.\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the new information we provide?O_LIDuring aortic valve stenosis, expression pattern of vesicle-associated regulatory miRNAs is altered.\nC_LIO_LIPatient-derived aortic valve tissue demonstrated an increased expression of miR-145-5p in humans, as well as in aortic valve explants from an experimental murine AVS model.\nC_LIO_LIMiR145-5p contributes to calcification of the aortic valve through ZEB2, a transcriptional repressor of ALPL, in valvular interstitial cells.\nC_LIO_LIExtracellular vesicular shuttling of miR-145-5p contributes to valvular cell-cell crosstalk and plays a role in the pathogenesis of AVS.\nC_LI"

    "abstract": "Cell culture, the workhorse of biomedical research, is generally considered to be hyperoxic. However, oxygen consumption by cells is underappreciated. High cellular respiration rates can rapidly deplete oxygen, resulting in local hypoxia. Increasing pericellular oxygen levels rewired the metabolism of multiple post-mitotic cell-lines, both in monolayer and organoid culture. Under standard conditions, cultured adipocytes are hypoxic and highly glycolytic. Increased oxygen availability diverted glucose flux toward mitochondria and increased lipogenesis from glucose-derived carbon. These metabolic changes were coupled to thousands of gene expression changes, and rendered adipocytes more sensitive to insulin and lipolytic stimuli. Importantly, pathway analyses revealed increasing oxygen tension made in vitro adipocytes more similar to in vivo adipose tissue. hPSC-derived hepatocytes and cardiac organoids were also functionally enhanced by increased oxygen. Our findings suggest that oxygen is limiting in many standard cell culture systems, and highlight how controlling oxygen availability can improve translatability of cell models."

    "abstract": "Cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the intricacy of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. In addition, disorders not yet known as ciliopathy but have genes that produce cilia localizing proteins have yet to be classified. Here we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary, or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein. Additionally, the orthologs of disease genes are also provided for mice, zebrafish, Xenopus, Drosophila, and C. elegans. CiliaMiner (https://kaplanlab.shinyapps.io/ciliaminer) aims to serve the cilia community with its comprehensive content, and highly enriched interactive heatmaps, and will be continually updated."

    "abstract": "Adaptation to ocean climate is increasingly recognized as an important driver of diversity in marine species despite the lack of physical barriers to dispersal and the presence of pelagic stages in many taxa. A robust understanding of the genomic and ecological processes involved in structuring populations is lacking for most marine species, often hindering management and conservation action. Cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), is a temperate reef fish that displays both pelagic early life history stages and strong site-associated homing as adults; the species is also presently of interest for use as a cleaner fish in salmonid aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Here we produce a chromosome-level genome assembly for cunner and characterize spatial population structure throughout Atlantic Canada using whole genome resequencing. The genome assembly spanned 0.72 Gbp and resolved 24 chromosomes; whole genome resequencing of 803 individuals from 20 locations spanning from Newfoundland to New Jersey identified approximately 11 million genetic variants. Principal component analysis revealed four distinct regional groups in Atlantic Canada, including three near the range edge in Newfoundland. Pairwise FST and selection scans revealed consistent signals of differentiation and selection at discrete genomic regions including adjacent peaks on chromosome 10 recurring across multiple pairwise comparisons (i.e., FST 0.5-0.75). Redundancy analysis suggested significant association of environmental variables related to benthic temperature and oxygen range with genomic structure, again highlighting the previously identified region on chromosome 10. Our results suggest that climate associated adaptation in this temperate reef fish drives regional diversity despite high early life history dispersal potential."

Fast and accurate methods to search databases of millions of structures will be essential to this endeavour, in the same way that fast protein sequence searching underpins much of bioinformatics. We train a simple graph neural network using supervised contrastive learning to learn a low-dimensional embedding of protein structure. The embedding can be used to search structures against large structural databases with accuracy comparable to current methods.

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR-seq) has provided numerous human immunoglobulin (IG) sequences allowing specific B cell receptor (BCR) studies such as the antigen-driven evolution of antibodies (IG secreted molecules). AIRR-seq data allows researchers to examine intra-clonal differences caused primarily by affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation processes. Understating the diversity of antibodies and how they evolve could help elucidate the generation of antibodies with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Consequently, retracing their evolutionary history could also help to clarify how vaccines or pathogen exposition drive the humoral immune response. Computational methods are necessary for large-scale evaluation of AIRR-seq properties. Currently, there is no efficient and interactive tool for analyzing intra-clonal diversity, permitting users to explore AIRR-seq data and potentially discover discriminating clonal features. We developed ViCloD, a web server for large-scale visual analysis of repertoire clonality and intra-clonal diversity. ViCloD uses data preprocessed by IMGT and performs evolutionary and statistical analyses, producing a set of valuable plots. The web server presents diverse functionalities, including repertoire navigation, clonal abundance analysis, and intra-clonal evolutionary tree reconstruction. Users can download the analyzed data in different table formats and save the generated plots as image files. ViCloD is a versatile analytical tool that can help researchers and clinicians in their investigations involving clonal diversity analysis. It is user-friendly, simple, accessible, and open to all users. Moreover, its pipeline is optimized to process hundreds of thousands of sequences in a few minutes, allowing intra-clonal diversity analysis in large and complex repertoires."

    "date": "2022-11-28",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the primary drivers of cervical cancers, and often the HPV DNA gets integrated into the host genome. Although the oncogenic impact of HPV encoded genes (such as E6/E7) is well known, the cis-regulatory effect of integrated HPV DNA on host chromatin structure and gene regulation remains less understood. Here, we investigate the genome-wide patterns of HPV integrations and associated host gene expression changes in the context of chromatin states and topologically associating domains (TADs). We find that HPV integrations are significantly enriched and depleted in active and inactive chromatin regions, respectively. Interestingly, regardless of the chromatin state, the genomic regions flanking HPV integrations showed transcriptional upregulation. Nevertheless, the upregulation (both local and long-range) is mostly confined to the TADs with integration and does not affect the adjacent TADs. Few TADs showed recurrent integrations associated with overexpression of oncogenes within them (such as MYC, PVT1, TP63 and ERBB2), regardless of the proximity. To further understand the long-range effect, we performed HiC and 4C-seq analyses in HeLa and observed chromatin looping interaction between the integrated HPV and MYC/PVT1 regions (situated [~]500 kb apart), leading to allele-specific overexpression of these genes. Again, these chromatin interactions involving integrated HPV are mostly observed within the same TAD. Together, these results suggest the cis-regulatory potential of integrated HPV DNA that drives host gene upregulation at intra-TAD level in cervical cancer. Based on this, we propose HPV integrations can trigger multimodal oncogenic activation to promote cancer progression."

    "abstract": "Glucose is a universal energy currency for living organisms, however, its non-energetic functions in processes such as differentiation are undefined. In epidermis, differentiating cells exhibit dynamic changes in gene expression1-4 driven by specific transcription factors (TFs)5-9. The interplay between such TFs and biomolecules that also change in this process is not understood. Metabolomic analyses revealed that increased intracellular glucose accompanies differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. This elevation also occurred in differentiating cells from other tissues and was verified in epidermal tissue engineered with glucose sensors, which detected a glucose gradient that peaked in the outermost differentiated layers. Free glucose accumulation, unaccompanied by its increased metabolism, was essential for epidermal differentiation and required GLUT1, GLUT3, and SGLT1 transporters. Glucose affinity chromatography and azido-glucose click chemistry uncovered glucose binding to diverse regulatory proteins, including the IRF6 TF, whose epidermal knockout confirmed its requirement in glucose-dependent differentiation. Direct glucose binding enabled IRF6 dimerization, DNA binding, genomic localization, and induction of IRF6 target genes, including essential pro-differentiation TFs GRHL1, GRHL3, HOPX and PRDM1. The IRF6R84C mutant found in undifferentiated cancers was unable to bind glucose. These data identify a new role for glucose as a gradient morphogen that modulates protein multimerization in cellular differentiation."

    "abstract": "Mitotic bookmarking transcription factors (TFs) are thought to mediate rapid and accurate post-mitotic gene reactivation. However, the loss of individual bookmarking TFs often leads to the deregulation of only a small proportion of their mitotic targets, raising doubts on the significance and importance of their bookmarking function. Here, we used targeted proteomics of the mitotic bookmarking TF ESRRB, an orphan nuclear receptor, to discover an unexpected redundancy among members of the protein superfamily of nuclear receptors. Focusing on the nuclear receptor NR5A2, which together with ES-RRB is essential for mouse pluripotency, we demonstrate conjoint bookmarking activity of both factors on promoters and enhancers of a large fraction of active genes, particularly the most rapidly and strongly reactivated ones. Upon fast and simultaneous degradation of both factors during mitotic exit, hundreds of mitotic targets of ESRRB/NR5A2, including key players of the pluripotency network, display attenuated transcriptional reactivation. We propose that redundancy in mitotic bookmarking TFs, especially by nuclear receptors, confers robustness to the reestablishment of gene regulatory networks after mitosis."

    "abstract": "We derive approximate expressions under various conditions of validity over both pre- and post-steady state regimes of the velocity-substrate-inhibitor phase-spaces of fully and partially competitive enzyme kinetic schemes. Our refinement over the currently available standard quasi steady state approximations (QSSA) seems to be valid for wide range of enzyme to substrate and inhibitor ratios. Further, we show that, the enzyme-inhibitor-substrate system can exhibit a complicated dynamical behavior with non-monotonic trend in the temporal depletion of the substrate and there is also a possibility of the occurrence of two steady states with respect to enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes. We define the ratios fS ={nu} max/(KMS + e0) and fS = umax/(KMI + e0) as the acceleration factors with respect to the conversion dynamics of substrate and inhibitor into their respective products. Here KMS and KMI are the Michaelis-Menten parameters associated with the binding of substrate and inhibitor with the enzyme, vmax and umax are the respective maximum reaction velocities. When fS/fI < 1, then the enzyme-substrate complex can reach the full-fledged steady state only after the depletion of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. On the other hand, when fS/fI > 1 then the enzyme-inhibitor complex can reach the full-fledged steady state only after the depletion of the enzyme-substrate complex. This complicated behavior of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor system especially when fS/fI = 1 is the root cause of large amount of error in the estimation of various kinetic parameters both in the cases of fully and partially competitive inhibition schemes using the standard QSSA methods. Remarkably, we show that our refined expressions for the reaction velocities over enzyme-substrate-inhibitor space can control this error more significantly than the currently available standard QSSA velocity expressions."

In the extracellular space, vimentin can bind surfaces of other cells and the extracellular matrix, and the interaction between extracellular vimentin and other cell types can trigger changes in cellular functions, such as activation of fibroblasts to a fibrotic phenotype. The mechanism by which extracellular vimentin binds external cell membranes and whether vimentin alone can act as an adhesive anchor for cells is largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that various cell types (normal and vimentin null fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, A549 lung carcinoma cells) attach to and spread on polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates covalently linked to vimentin. Using traction force microscopy and spheroid expansion assays, we characterize how different cell types respond to extracellular vimentin. Cell attachment to and spreading on vimentin-coated surfaces is inhibited by hyaluronic acid (HA) degrading enzymes, HA synthase inhibitors, soluble heparin, or N-acetyl glucosamine, treatments that have little or no effect on the same cell types binding to collagen-coated hydrogels. These studies highlight the effectiveness of substrate-bound vimentin as a ligand for cells and suggest that carbohydrate structures, including the glycocalyx and glycosylated cell surface proteins that contain N-acetyl glucosamine, form a novel class of adhesion receptors for extracellular vimentin."

Clinical presentation of r-HAT in Malawi varies between the different foci and differs from East African HAT clinical phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into the transcriptomic profiles of patients with early stage 1 and late stage 2 HAT disease in Malawi. Whole blood from individuals infected with T. b. rhodesiense was used for RNA-Seq. Control samples were from healthy trypanosome negative individuals matched on sex, age range, and disease focus. Illumina sequence FASTQ reads were aligned to the GRCh38 release 84 human genome sequence using HiSat2 and differential analysis was done in R using the DESeq2 package. XGR, ExpressAnalyst and InnateDB algorithms were used for functional annotation and gene enrichment analysis of significant differentially expressed genes. RNA-seq was done on 25 healthy controls and 23 r-HAT case samples of which 3 case samples were excluded for downstream analysis as outliers. 4519 genes were significantly differentially expressed (p adjusted <0.05) in individuals with early stage 1 r-HAT disease (n = 12) and 1824 genes in individuals with late stage 2 r-HAT disease (n = 8). Enrichment of innate immune response genes through neutrophil activation was identified in individuals with both early and late stages of the disease. Additionally, lipid metabolism genes were enriched in late stage 2 disease. We further identified uniquely upregulated genes (log2 Fold Change 1.4 - 2.0) in stage 1 (ZNF354C) and stage 2 (TCN1 and MAGI3) blood. Our data brings new insight into the human transcriptome landscape during T. b. rhodesiense infection. We have further identified key biological pathways and transcripts during stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT. Lastly, we have identified potential diagnostic biomarkers that may be used for staging of r-HAT disease."

    "abstract": "Exercise effectively prevents obesity-related disorders, but it is unclear whether the beneficial health effects of exercise are restricted to unique circadian windows. Therefore, we aimed to study whether timing of exercise training differentially modulates the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease currently estimated to affect over two billion people worldwide. We endurance-trained high fat-high cholesterol-fed NAFLD-prone male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice five times per week for eight weeks either in the early (ZT13) or in the late (ZT22) active phase and assessed the NAFLD score (histology) and hepatic inflammation compared to sedentary mice. Exercise training prevented an increase in body fat mass and fasting plasma glucose as expected, but neither early nor late training affected liver triglyceride or cholesterol content compared to sedentary mice, likely due to a very early stage of hepatic steatosis. In line, hepatic expression of de novo lipogenesis genes (e.g., Fasn, Srebp1c) was similarly downregulated by early and late training. However, exercise had a distinct time-dependent effect on hepatic inflammation, as only early training promoted an influx of pro-inflammtory cells into the liver paired with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. Tnfa, Il1b). This data suggests that the timing of exercise is a critical factor for the effect on cardiometabolic disease development."

    "abstract": "Cellular membraneless organelles termed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules often are enriched in messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules relative to the surrounding cytoplasm. Yet, the spatial localization and diffusion of mRNAs in close proximity to phase separated RNP granules is not well understood. In this study, we performed single molecule fluorescence imaging experiments of mRNAs in live cells in the presence of two types of RNP granules, stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (PB), which are distinct in their molecular composition and function. We developed a new colocalization imaging algorithm that was employed to determine the accurate positions of individual mRNAs relative to the granules boundaries. We found that mRNA is often localized at granule boundaries, an observation consistent with recently published data1,2. We suggest that mRNA molecules become spontaneously confined at the RNP granule boundary similar to the adsorption of polymer molecules at liquid-liquid interfaces, which is observed in various technological and biological processes."

    "abstract": "The occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common and socially significant arrhythmias, is associated with the presence of fibrosis sites. Fibrosis is the presence of non-conductive fibroblast cells, separating cardiomyocytes and introducing heterogeneity into the conducting atrial tissue. Thus fibrosis may be a substrate of spiral-wave reentry, provoking the occurrence of AF and is often associated with its persistent form. In this work, we propose for the first time a fundamentally new approach to modeling the fibrotic heart that takes into account the cellular structure of the tissue: a realistic texture of atrial tissue remodeled by fibroblasts is generated by the Potts model, and the local membrane potential of individual cells is calculated by the Courtemanche model. We have shown the occurrence of conductive pathways in such a system with a low proportion of fibroblasts (up to 10%) and revealed the connection of the form of the action potential (AP) of cells with their location in the tissue and the direction of the propagating wave front. The combination of these effects creates dynamic heterogeneity of the conducting tissue and affects the migration and pinning of spiral waves, which makes the model a potential tool for prognostic modeling of AP and search for ablation targets. The computer prediction of ablation targets (reentry nodes) will help to increase the efficiency of treatment of patients with persistent form of AF."

    "abstract": "Lanthipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides that are generated from precursor peptides through a dehydration and cyclization process in the biosynthetic pathways. In contrast to most other lanthipeptide synthetases, ProcM, a class II lanthipeptide synthetase, demonstrates high substrate tolerance. It is enigmatic that a single enzyme can catalyze the cyclization process of a diverse range of substrates with high fidelity. Previous studies suggested that the site-selectivity of lanthionine formation is determined by substrate sequence rather than by the enzyme. However, exactly how substrate sequence contributes to site-selective lanthipeptide biosynthesis is not clear. In this study, we performed molecular dynamic simulations for ProcA3.3 core peptide variants to explore how the predicted solution structure of the substrate without enzyme correlates to final product formation. Our simulation results support a model in which the secondary structure of the core peptide controls the ring pattern of the final product. We also demonstrate that the dehydration step in the biosynthesis pathway does not influence the site-selectivity of ring formation. In addition, we performed simulation for the core peptides of ProcA1.1 and 2.8, which are well-suited candidates to investigate the connection between order of ring formation and solution structure. Simulation results indicate that in both cases, C-terminal ring formation is more likely which was supported by experimental results. Our findings indicate that the substrate sequence and its solution structure can be used to predict the site-selectivity and order of ring formation, and that secondary structure is a crucial factor influencing the site-selectivity. Taken together, these findings will facilitate our understanding of the lanthipeptide biosynthetic mechanism and accelerate bioengineering efforts for lanthipeptide-derived products."

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed millions of lives worldwide, not to mention innumerable losses in the global economy and disruptions in social relationships. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art treatments still lag behind the fast emergence of new variants of concern. The key to resolve this issue is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals with innovative antiviral mechanisms in which coronaviruses are deactivated regardless of their variant development. Herein, we report a new antiviral strategy involving extracellular disintegration of viral proteins that are indispensable for viral infection with hyperanion-grafted enediyne molecules. The sulfate groups ensure low cellular permeability and rather low cytotoxicity of the molecules, while the core enediyne generates reactive radical species and causes significant damage to the spike (S) protein of coronavirus. The enediyne compounds exhibit antiviral activity at micromolar to nanomolar concentrations, and the selectivity index of up to 20,000 against four kinds of human coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant, suggesting the high potential of this new strategy in combating the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Experimental findings for SARS-CoV-2 related to the glycan biochemistry of coronaviruses indicate that attachments from spike protein to glycoconjugates on the surfaces of red blood cells (RBCs), other blood cells and endothelial cells are key to the infectivity and morbidity of COVID-19. To provide further insight into these glycan attachments and their potential clinical relevance, the classic hemagglutination (HA) assay was applied using spike protein from the Wuhan, Alpha, Delta and Omicron B.1.1.529 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 mixed with human RBCs. The electrostatic potential of the central region of spike protein from these four lineages was studied through molecular modeling simulations. Inhibition of spike protein-induced HA was tested using the macrocyclic lactone ivermectin (IVM), which is indicated to bind strongly to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein glycan sites. The results of these experiments were, first, that spike protein from these four lineages of SARS-CoV-2 induced HA. Omicron induced HA at a significantly lower threshold concentration of spike protein than for the three prior lineages and was much more electropositive on its central spike protein region. IVM blocked HA when added to RBCs prior to spike protein and reversed HA when added afterwards. These results validate and extend prior findings on the role of glycan bindings of viral spike protein in COVID-19. They furthermore suggest therapeutic options using competitive glycan-binding agents such as IVM and may help elucidate rare serious adverse effects (AEs) associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines which use spike protein as the generated antigen."

Effective computational methods that provide a sequence-based prediction of probable phosphorylation sites are desirable to guide functional experiments or constrain search spaces for proteomics-based experimental pipelines. Currently, the most successful methods train deep learning models on amino acid composition representations. However, recently proposed protein language models provide enriched sequence representations that may contain higher-level pattern information on which more performant phosphorylation site predictions may be based.\n\nResultsWe explored the applicability of protein language models to general phosphorylation site prediction. We found that training prediction models on top of protein language models yield a relative improvement of between 13.4% and 63.3% in terms of area under the precision-recall curve over the state-of-the-art predictors. Advanced model interpretation and model transferability experiments reveal that across models, protease-specific cleavage patterns give rise to a protease-specific training bias that results in an overly optimistic estimation of phosphorylation site prediction performance, an important caveat in the application of advanced machine learning approaches to protein modification prediction based on proteomics data.\n\nAvailability and implementationPhosphoLingo code, datasets, and predictions are available at https://github.com/jasperzuallaert/PhosphoLingo.\n\nContactjasper.zuallaert@vib-ugent.be, sven_degroeve@vib-ugent.be\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary materials are available at bioRxiv"

    "abstract": "Fungal plant pathogens pose a significant threat to biodiversity and food security worldwide. This threat is aggravated by their rapidly evolving genomes that adapt to evade host plant defenses, reducing the efficacy of deployed resistant crops. Magnaporthe oryzae infects rice, wheat, and many other grasses, resulting in significant crop losses each year. Transposable elements (TEs) are hypothesized to be involved in the evolution and rapid adaptation of M. oryzae. However, there is still much to understand about how these elements behave in different M. oryzae host-specific lineages. In this study, we completed the annotation and phylogenetic classification of TEs in five lineages of M. oryzae. We identified differences in TE content between these lineages, and showed that recent lineage-specific expansions of certain TEs have contributed to greater TE content in rice-infecting and Setaria-infecting lineages. We reconstructed the histories of LTR-retrotransposon expansions and found them to have experienced complex dynamics, where some were caused by the proliferation of one element, while others consisted of multiple elements from an older population of TEs that proliferated in parallel. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting the recent transfer of a DNA transposon between rice and wheat M. oryzae lineages, and a region showing evidence of recombination between those lineages, which could have facilitated such a transfer. These results point towards key differences in TE dynamics, evolutionary history, and adaptive potential between the rice-and-Setaria-infecting and the wheat-Lolium-and-Eleusine-infecting lineage groups."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is one of the most pressing health challenges of our time, is driven by specific genetic determinants, primarily by the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) of bacteria. In our work, we investigated the occurrence of ARGs in the genomes of tick-borne bacterial species that can cause human infections. For this purpose, we processed short/long reads of 1550 bacterial isolates of the genera Anaplasma (n=20), Bartonella (n=131), Borrelia (n=311), Coxiella (n=73), Ehrlichia (n=13), Francisella (n=959) and Rickettsia (n=43) generated by second/third generation sequencing that have been freely accessible at the NCBI SRA repository. From Francisella tularensis, 98.9% of the samples contained the FTU-1 gene, and 16.3% contained additional ARGs. Only 2.2% of isolates from other genera (Bartonella: 2, Coxiella: 8, Ehrlichia: 1, Rickettsia: 2) contained any ARG. We found that the odds of ARG occurrence in Coxiella samples were significantly higher in isolates related to farm animals than from other sources. Our results describe a lack in ARGs in these bacteria and suggest that antibiotic susceptibility testing might be considered before the treatment of tick-borne infections in farm animals."

    "abstract": "Elimination of intermuscular bones (IMBs) is vital to the aquaculture industry of cyprinids. In our previous study, we characterized bmp6 as essential in the development of IMBs in zebrafish. Knockout of bmp6 results in the absence of IMBs in zebrafish without affecting growth and reproduction. Therefore, we hypothesized that bmp6 could be used to generate new cyprinid strains without IMBs by gene editing. In this study, we established a gene editing strategy for knocking out the two orthologs of bmp6 in diploid crucian carp (Carassius auratus). We obtained an F3 population with both orthologs knocked out, in which no IMBs were detected by bone staining and X-ray, indicating that the new strain without IMBs (named WUCI strain) was successfully generated. Furthermore, we extensively evaluated the performance of the new strain in growth, reproduction, nutrient components, muscle texture and structure, and metabolites in muscle. The results showed that the WUCI strain grew faster than the wild-type crucian carp at 4-month-age. The reproductive performance and flesh quality did not show significant differences between the WUCI strain and wild-type crucian carp. Moreover, the metabolomics analysis suggested that the muscle tissues of the WUCI strain significantly enriched some metabolites belonging to the Thiamine metabolism, Nicotinate and Nicotinamide Metabolism pathway, which plays beneficial effects in anti-aging, antioxidant, and anti-radiation damage. In conclusion, we established a strategy to eliminate IMBs in crucian carp and obtain a WUCI strain whose performance was expected compared to the wild-type crucian carp; meanwhile, the WUCI strain enriched some beneficial metabolites to human health in muscle tissue. This study is the first report that a cyprinid strain without IMBs, which could be stably inherited, was obtained worldwide; it provided excellent germplasm for the cyprinids aquaculture industry and a useful molecular tool for eliminating IMBs in other cyprinids."

    "abstract": "Differentiated Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs) express a unique network of splice isoforms (smooth muscle specific alternative splicing - SM-AS) in functionally critical genes including those comprising the contractile machinery. We previously described RNA Binding Protein Multiple Splicing (RBPMS) as a potent driver of contractile, aortic tissue like SM-AS in VSMCs using rodent models. What is unknown is how RBPMS affects VSMC phenotype and behaviour. Here, we use human embryonic stem cell-derived VSMCs (hES-VSMCs) to dissect the role of RBPMS in SM-AS in human cells and determine the impact on VSMC phenotypic properties. hES-VSMCs are inherently immature and display only partially differentiated SM-AS patterns while RBPMS levels are undetectable endogenously. Hence, we used an over-expression system and found that RBPMS induces SM-AS patterns in hES-VSMCs akin to the contractile tissue VSMC splicing patterns in multiple events. We present in silico and experimental findings that support RBPMS splicing activity as mediated through direct binding and via functional cooperativity with splicing factor RBFOX2 on a significant subset of targets. Finally, we demonstrate that RBPMS is capable of altering the motility and the proliferative properties of hES-VSMCs to mimic a more differentiated state. Overall, this study emphasizes a critical splicing regulatory role for RBPMS in human VSMCs and provides evidence of phenotypic modulation by RBPMS."

    "abstract": "The Ku70/80 heterodimer is a key player in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair but has also been involved in other cellular functions like telomere regulation and maintenance, in which Kus role is not fully characterized. It was previously reported that knockout of Ku80 in a human cell line results in lethality, but the underlying cause of Ku essentiality in human cells has yet to be fully explored. Here, we established conditional Ku70 knockout cells to study the essentiality of Ku70 function. Endogenous Ku70 knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in cells where Ku70 expression was maintained through integration of an HA-tagged Ku70 cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Ku70 conditional knockout cell lines were identified via western blotting, and edits were validated by Sanger sequencing. We visually observed cell death in Ku70 knockout cells 8-10 days post Ku70-HA depletion, and loss of viability following Ku depletion was quantified using crystal violet assays. Interestingly, assessment of telomere length in Ku70 knockout cells using telomere restriction fragment analyses did not reveal any changes in average telomere length following Ku70-HA depletion. Immunofluorescence analysis used to assess {gamma}H2AX foci accumulation as a measure of double-stranded DNA breaks following Ku70-HA depletion allowed us to conclude that increased DNA damage is not the driving cause of loss of cell viability. Finally, quantitative proteome analysis of Ku70 knockout cells following Ku70-HA depletion identified a number of pathways and proteins that are significantly dysregulated following the loss of Ku70, including processes which Ku function has been previously associated with such as cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this conditional Ku70 knockout system reveals that loss of Ku affects multiple cellular processes and pathways and suggests that Ku plays critical roles in other cellular processes beyond DNA repair and telomere maintenance to maintain cell viability.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Ku70/80 heterodimer is a key player in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, where it acts as a scaffold for other repair factors needed to process double-stranded DNA breaks. Ku has also been involved in other cellular functions like telomere regulation and maintenance, in which Kus role is not fully characterized. Previous data suggest that while loss of Ku70/80 can be tolerated in other species, Ku is essential to humans. We have established a conditional Ku70 knockout in HEK293 cells to evaluate the basis of Ku essentiality in human cells. While we observed loss of cell viability upon Ku depletion, we did not observe significant changes in telomere length nor did we record lethal levels of DNA damage upon loss of Ku, suggesting that the reasons for the loss of viability is not linked to the functions of Ku in DNA repair or at telomeres. Analysis of global proteome changes following Ku70 depletion revealed dysregulations of several cellular pathways including cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis. Our study reveals that loss of Ku affects multiple cellular processes and pathways and suggests that Ku plays critical roles in cellular processes beyond DNA repair and telomere maintenance to maintain cell viability."

    "abstract": "Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme responsible for maintaining the telomeric end of the chromosome. The telomerase enzyme requires two main components to function: the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA (TR), which provides the template for telomeric DNA synthesis. TR is a long noncoding RNA, which forms the basis of a large structural scaffold upon which many accessory proteins can bind and form the complete telomerase holoenzyme. These accessory protein interactions are required for telomerase activity and regulation inside cells. The interacting partners of TERT have been well studied in yeast, human, and Tetrahymena models, but not in lower eukaryotes, including clinically relevant human parasites. Here, using the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) as a model, we have identified the interactome of T. brucei TERT (TbTERT) using a mass spectrometry-based approach. We identified previously known and unknown interacting factors of TbTERT, highlighting unique features of T. brucei telomerase biology. These unique interactions with TbTERT, suggest mechanistic differences in telomere maintenance between T. brucei and other eukaryotes."

Identifying biologic and genetic effects on DNA methylation (DNAm) in endometrium increases understanding of mechanisms that influence gene regulation predisposing to endometriosis and offers an opportunity for novel therapeutic target discovery. Herein, we characterize variation in endometrial DNAm and its association with menstrual cycle phase, endometriosis, and genetic variants through analysis of genome-wide genotype data and methylation at 759,345 DNAm sites in endometrial samples from 984 deeply-phenotyped participants. We identify significant differences in DNAm profiles between menstrual cycle phases and at four DNAm sites between stage III/IV endometriosis and controls. We estimate that 15.4% of the variation in endometriosis is captured by DNAm, and identify DNAm networks associated with endometriosis. DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis identified 118,185 independent cis-mQTL including some tissue-specific effects. We find significant differences in DNAm profiles between endometriosis sub- phenotypes and a significant association between genetic regulation of methylation in endometrium and disease risk, providing functional evidence for genomic targets contributing to endometriosis risk and pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of mutation spread in engineered cell populations is a sought-after goal in synthetic biology. Until now, models that capture these processes have been lacking, either by failing to account for the diversity of mutation types, or by failing to link the growth rate of a cell to the consumption of shared cellular resources by synthetic constructs. In this study we address these shortcomings by building a novel mutation-aware modelling framework of cell growth in a turbidostat. Our framework allows users to input essential design elements of their synthetic constructs so as to predict the time evolution of different mutation phenotypes and protein production dynamics. Its structure allows quick mutation-based analysis of any construct design, from single-gene constructs to multi-gene devices with regulatory elements. We show how our framework can generate new insights into industrial applications, such as how the design of synthetic constructs impacts long-term protein yield and genetic shelf-life. Our framework also uncovers new mutation-driven design paradigms for synthetic gene regulatory networks, such as how mutations can temporarily increase the bistability of toggle switches, or how repressilators can be resistant to single points of failure."

    "abstract": "We investigate intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of phase separating proteins regarding their impact on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the full protein. Our theoretical approach uses a mean-field theory that accounts for sequence-dependent electrostatic interactions via a random-phase approximation (RPA) and in addition allows for variable salt concentration for the condensed and dilute protein phases. The numerical solution of the complete phase diagrams together with the tie lines that we derive for this model system leaves two parameters to be determined by fitting experimental data on concentrations of all species involved in the system. For our comparisons, we focus on two proteins, PGL-3 and FUS, known to undergo LLPS. For PGL-3 we predict that its long IDR near the C-terminus promotes LLPS, which we validate through direct comparison with in vitro experimental results under the same physiological conditions. For the structurally more complex protein FUS the role of the low complexity (LC) domain in LLPS has been intensively studied. Apart from the LC domain we here investigate theoretically two IDRs, one near the N-terminus and another near the C-terminus. Our theoretical analysis of these domains predict that the IDR at the N-terminus (aa 1-285) is the main driver of LLPS of FUS by comparison to in vitro experiments of the full length protein under the same physiological temperature and salt conditions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIntrinsically disordered proteins are drivers of cellular liquid-liquid phase separation. However, it remains a challenge to directly predict the phase behaviour of a protein based on its primary sequence, and under physiological conditions. We present a random-phase approximation that allows for variable salt concentration and thus accounts for salt partitioning. We use this to link the sequence of the disordered regions with the behaviour of the complete protein through direct comparisons to in vitro phase-separation assays. In particular, for FUS we determine the exact region responsible for LLPS, weighting in a long-standing debate."

In the present paper, two-dimensional numerical simulations have been done to examine the droplet splitting process in an E Junction geometry microchannel. The two-phase level set method (LSM) has been used to analyze the mechanism of droplet formation and droplet splitting in an immiscible liquid/liquid two-phase flow. Governing equations on the flow field have been studied and solved using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The model was developed to simulate the mechanism of droplet splitting at the E-junction microchannel. This study provides a passive technique to split up microdroplets at the E-junction."

A major thrust of MPI research aims to sharpen the magnetic resolution of biocompatible SPIOs, which will be crucial for affordable and safe clinical translation. We recently reported on a new class of MPI tracers --called superferromagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SFMIOs) -- which offer much sharper magnetic saturation curves. SFMIOs experimentally demonstrate 10-fold improvement in both resolution and sensitivity. However, superferromagnetism is a relatively unexplored branch of physics and the nanoscale physics and dynamics of SFMIOs remain a mystery. Here we show experimentally that chaining of SPIOs can explain SFMIOs boost in SNR and resolution. We show how concentration, viscosity, transmit amplitude, and pre-polarization time can all affect SPIO chain formation and SFMIO behavior. These experiments will inform strategies on SFMIO chemical synthesis as well as SFMIO data acquisition pulse sequences."

Although the MPCs potential role in imaging and drug delivery processes have been studied, for their impactful use, specific molecular interactions between MPCs and biomolecules, mainly proteins and peptides should be explored in detail. In this work, we have carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between Au-based MPCs and an anticancer peptide, melittin. The MEL peptides get attached to the MPCs surface by the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the peptide amino acid residues with MPCs ligands. Additionally, the positively charged residues such as Lys and Arg, the Trp, and the N-terminal of the peptide anchor strongly to the MPC core playing a crucial role in the peptides overall stabilization on the MPC surface."

In this work, we combined structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, single-molecule imaging, and mutagenesis to construct a model of the core complex of the E. coli divisome composed of the essential septal cell wall synthase complex formed by FtsW and FtsI, and its regulators FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsN. We observed extensive interactions in four key regions in the periplasmic domains of the complex. FtsQ, FtsL, and FtsB scaffold FtsI in an extended conformation with the FtsI transpeptidase domain lifted away from the membrane through interactions among the C-terminal domains. FtsN binds between FtsI and FtsL in a region rich in residues with superfission (activating) and dominant negative (inhibitory) mutations. Mutagenesis experiments in cellulo and in silico revealed that the essential domain of FtsN functions as a tether to tie FtsI and FtsL together, impacting interactions between the anchor-loop of FtsI and the putative catalytic region of FtsW, suggesting a mechanism of how FtsN activates the cell wall synthesis activities of FtsW and FtsI."

    "date": "2022-11-28",
    "relevance": "1 Certainly Irrelevant",
    "abstract": "1Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are energetic signalling molecules with important functions in mammals. As their biosynthesis depends on ATP concentration, PP-InsPs are tightly connected to cellular energy homeostasis. Consequently, an increasing number of studies involves PP-InsPs in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, aspects of tumorigenesis, and hyperphosphatemia. Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signalling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS. Using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that PP-InsP levels decrease upon exposure to oxidative stressors in HCT116 cells. Application of quinone drugs, particularly {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that {beta}-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are oxygen dependent. Experiments in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells deficient of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) demonstrated that {beta}-lap requires NQO1-bioactivation to regulate the cellular metabolism of PP-InsPs. Critically, significant reductions in cellular ATP concentrations were not directly mirrored in reduced PP-InsP levels as shown in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells treated with {beta}-lap. The data presented here unveil new aspects of {beta}-lap pharmacology and its impact on PP-InsP levels. Our identification of different quinone drugs as modulators of PP-InsP synthesis will allow to better appreciate their overall impact on cellular function.\n\n2 Significance StatementInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are messenger molecules regulating various functions in mammals. They are associated with the oxidative stress response, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigate PP-InsP signalling in mammalian cells subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Applying the quinone {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap) generated intracellular ROS resulting in decreased PP-InsP levels. This indicates a key role of PP-InsPs in cellular signalling under oxidative stress. Moreover, {beta}-lap mediated PP-InsP signalling required oxygen and the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). Since quinone drugs are cytotoxic, our data provide a basis for further investigations into the role of PP-InsPs during quinone-dependent chemotherapies. This is of special relevance since a phase II clinical trial demonstrated {beta}-lap efficacy in a combination chemotherapy against pancreatic cancer."

The tumor suppressor NF2 has been shown to activate LATS1/2 kinases and interplay with Hippo pathway to suppress YAP-TEAD complex. But, whether and how NF2 could directly regulate TEAD remains unknown. We identified a direct link and physical interaction between NF2 and TEAD4. NF2 interacted with TEAD4 through its FERM domain and the C-terminal tail, and decreased protein stability of TEAD4 independently of LATS1/2 and YAP. Furthermore, NF2 inhibited TEAD4 palmitoylation and retained the cytoplasmic translocation of TEAD4, resulting in ubiquitination and dysfunction of TEAD4. Moreover, the interaction with TEAD4 is required for NF2 function to suppress cell proliferation. These findings revealed a new role of NF2 as a binding partner and inhibitor of the transcription factor TEAD, and would shed light on an alternative mechanism of how NF2 functions as a tumor suppressor through the Hippo signaling cascade."

To identify whether PTPs modify BMPR2 signaling we used a siRNA-mediated high throughput screening of 22,124 murine genes in mouse myoblastoma reporter cells using ID1 expression as read-out for BMPR2 signaling. We further experimentally validated the top hit, PTPN1 (PTP1B), in human healthy pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) either silenced by siRNA or exposed to hypoxia and confirmed its relevance to PAH by measuring PTPN1 levels in blood and PAECs collected from PAH patients. We identified PTPN1 as a novel regulator of BMPR2 signaling in PAECs, which is downregulated in the blood of PAH patients and documented that downregulation of PTPN1 is linked to endothelial dysfunction in PAECs. These findings point to a potential involvement for PTPN1 in PAH and will aid in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease."

State-of-the-art genome annotation assessment tools measure the completeness of a gene repertoire, but are blind to other types of errors, such as gene over-prediction or contamination.\n\nWe developed OMArk, a software relying on fast, alignment-free sequence comparisons between a query proteome and precomputed gene families across the tree of life. OMArk assesses not only the completeness, but also the consistency of the gene repertoire as a whole relative to closely related species. It also reports likely contamination events.\n\nWe validated OMArk with simulated data, then performed an analysis of the 1805 UniProt Eukaryotic Reference Proteomes, illustrating its usefulness for comparing and prioritizing proteomes based on their quality measures. In particular, we found strong evidence of contamination in 59 proteomes, and identified error propagation in avian gene annotation resulting from the use of a fragmented zebra finch proteome as reference.\n\nOMArk is available on GitHub (https://github.com/DessimozLab/OMArk), as a Python package on PyPi, and as an interactive online tool at https://omark.omabrowser.org/."

    "abstract": "Lysosomes degrade macromolecules and recycle their nutrient content to support cell function and survival over a broad range of metabolic conditions. Yet, the machineries involved in lysosomal recycling of many essential nutrients remain to be discovered, with a notable example being choline, an essential metabolite liberated in large quantities within the lysosome via the degradation of choline-containing lipids. To identify critical lysosomal choline transport pathways, we engineered metabolic dependency on lysosome-derived choline in pancreatic cancer cells. We then exploited this dependency to perform an endolysosome-focused CRISPR-Cas9 negative selection screen for genes mediating lysosomal choline recycling. Our screen identified the orphan lysosomal transmembrane protein SPNS1, whose loss leads to neurodegeneration-like disease in animal models, as critical for cell survival under free choline limitation. We find that SPNS1 loss leads to massive accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) within the lysosome. Mechanistically, we revealed that SPNS1 is required for the efflux of LPC species from the lysosome to enable their reesterification into choline-containing phospholipids in the cytosol. Using cell-based lipid uptake assays, we determine that SPNS1 functions as a proton gradient-dependent transporter of LPC. Collectively, our work defines a novel lysosomal phospholipid salvage pathway that is required for cell survival under conditions of choline limitation, and more broadly, provides a robust platform to deorphan lysosomal gene functions."

    "abstract": "During the early stages of disease development, protein biomarkers can leak into the blood creating opportunities for early diagnosis of disease with minimally invasive sampling. These proteins biomarkers however are often masked by the presence of more abundant functional blood proteins, making specific detection a challenge with most current immunoassays. We we report on the development of a magnetic bead based solid-phase PEA (SP-PEA) for sensitive detection of proteins in plasma and serum samples. Antibody functionalized magnetic beads are used to capture the target of interest. Following capture, non-specifically bound proteins are washed off before PEA probes are added for detection of the bound proteins. Compared to hoogenous PEA, SP-PEA admits the use of larger sample volumes to increase available target molecules, higher concentration of detection reagents for more efficient formation of detection complexes and washes for removal of nonspecific background. We compared SP-PEA to solution phase PEA for the detection of cytokines: interlukin-6, interlukin-2, interlukin-4, interlukin-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, and we demonstrated an increased sensitivity by 15 to 60 fold in buffer and chicken serum. We further expanded SP-PEA to detect extracellular vesicles (EVs) through combinations of proteins on the surface of specific EV populations."

    "abstract": "Modern multi-omic technologies can generate deep multi-scale profiles. However, differences in data modalities, multicollinearity of the data, and large numbers of irrelevant features make the analyses and integration of high-dimensional omic datasets challenging. Here, we present Significant Latent factor Interaction Discovery and Exploration (SLIDE), a first-in-class interpretable machine learning technique for identifying significant interacting latent factors underlying outcomes of interest from high-dimensional omic datasets. SLIDE makes no assumptions regarding data-generating mechanisms, comes with theoretical guarantees regarding identifiability of the latent factors/corresponding inference, outperforms/performs at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction, and provides inference beyond prediction. Using SLIDE on scRNA-seq data from systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, we first uncovered significant interacting latent factors underlying SSc pathogenesis. In addition to accurately predicting SSc severity and outperforming existing benchmarks, SLIDE uncovered significant factors that included well-elucidated altered transcriptomic states in myeloid cells and fibroblasts, an intriguing keratinocyte-centric signature validated by protein staining, and a novel mechanism involving altered HLA signaling in myeloid cells, that has support in genetic data. SLIDE also worked well on spatial transcriptomic data and was able to accurately identify significant interacting latent factors underlying immune cell partitioning by 3D location within lymph nodes. Finally, SLIDE leveraged paired scRNA-seq and TCR-seq data to elucidate latent factors underlying extents of clonal expansion of CD4 T cells in a nonobese diabetic model of T1D. The latent factors uncovered by SLIDE included well-known activation markers, inhibitory receptors and intracellular regulators of receptor signaling, but also honed in on several novel naive and memory states that standard analyses missed. Overall, SLIDE is a versatile engine for biological discovery from modern multi-omic datasets."

Despite advances in experimental techniques, we can still measure only a fraction of the processes that govern GRN dynamics. To infer the properties of GRNs using partial observation, unobserved sequential processes can be replaced with distributed time delays, yielding non-Markovian models. Inference methods based on the resulting model suffer from the curse of dimensionality.\n\nResultsWe develop a simulation-based Bayesian MCMC method for the efficient and accurate inference of GRN parameters when only some of their products are observed. We illustrate our approach using a two-step activation model: An activation signal leads to the accumulation of an unobserved regulatory protein, which triggers the expression of observed fluorescent proteins. With prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein. We can estimate the delay and kinetic parameters characterizing target regulation including transcription, translation, and target searching of an unobserved protein from experimental measurements of the products of its target gene. Our method is scalable and can be used to analyze non-Markovian models with hidden components.\n\nAvailabilityAccompanying code in R is available at https://github.com/Mathbiomed/SimMCMC.\n\nContactjaekkim@kaist.ac.kr or kresimir.josic@gmail.com or cbskust@korea.ac.kr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cancers (HCs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that affect blood, bone marrow and lymphatic system. Despite arising from derivatives of hematopoietic stem cells, each disease has a unique set of characterizing genomic irregularities. Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) have been useful to analyze and integrate information of cancer transcriptomes. Here, we explored the co-expression landscape in HC, by inferring GCNs from four hematopoietic cancers (B and T-cell acute leukemia, -BALL, TALL-, acute myeloid leukemia - AML- and multiple myeloma -MM-) as well as non-cancer bone marrow. We characterized their structure (topological features) and function (enrichment analyses). We found that, as in other types of cancer, the highest co-expression interactions are intra-chromosomal, which is not the case for control GCNs. We also detected a highly co-expressed group of overexpressed pseudogenes in HC networks. The four GCNs present only a small fraction of common interactions, related to canonical functions, like immune response or erythrocyte differentiation. Those genes are differentially expressed in a unique fashion for each HC. For instance, cell cycle-associated genes are underexpressed in MM and AML, slightly overexpressed in BALL but highly overexpressed in TALL. With this approach, we are able to reveal cancer-specific features useful for detection of disease manifestations."

    "abstract": "The spatial architecture of the genome can be categorized into distinct layers. Each layer plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and/or genomic integrity. Alterations at any level of the 3D genome can lead to an unwanted cascade of molecular events, which may ultimately drive the manifestation of disease. However, a comprehensive atlas of the mutations and structural genetic defects that affect genome organization has yet to be compiled. Moreover, we lack a centralized resource for interpretating the pathological effects of such genetic mutations. Therefore, we curated from the literature all the pathological alterations from the chromosome level on down to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to investigate these diverse genetic mutations. Using a two-phase scoring algorithm, 3DFunc, we scored the transcriptomic causality of all variants in the context of 3D genome architecture from 20 cancer and 15 normal tissues. Further, 3DFunc can identify pathological variant-gene pairs in non-oncological diseases. Finally, we constructed a web-based database, 3DGeOD (https://www.csuligroup.com/3DGeOD/home), to provide all the curated variants, genomic disruptions, as well as the scoring results derived from 3DFunc. In summary, our study constructed a 3D genome atlas of genetic variants and will serve as a valuable resource for mining the putative pathological effects of any genetic mutation."

    "abstract": "Visible light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT) is an emerging imaging modality that uses shorter wavelength in visible light range than conventional near infrared (NIR) light. It provides one-micron level axial resolution to improve image contrast to better separate stratified retinal layers, as well as provides microvascular oximetry with spatio-spectral analysis. However, due to the practical limitation of laser safety and comfort, the permissible illumination power is much lower than NIR OCT which can be challenging to obtain high quality VIS-OCT images and subsequent image analysis particularly in pathological eyes. Therefore, improving VIS-OCT image quality by denoising is an essential step in the overall workflow in VIS-OCT clinical applications. In this paper, we provide the first VIS-OCT retinal image dataset from normal eyes, including retinal layer annotation and noisy-clean image pairs. We propose an efficient co-learning deep learning framework for noisy-input segmentation embedded with a self-supervised denoising process. The same neural network performed both denoising and segmentation tasks simultaneously. The task performance is benchmarked qualitatively and quantitatively. The significant improvement of segmentation (2% higher Dice coefficient compared to segmentation-only process) for certain layers is observed when available annotation drops to 25%, indicating a potential angle for annotation-efficient training."

    "abstract": "Separating, collecting, and detecting specific cells and molecules from complex and heterogeneous samples is key for many biomedical, environmental, and food safety applications. Antibodies are widely used to specifically bind cells and molecules to a solid support such as a column or suspended bead to separate, wash, and concentrate them. However, nonspecific binding of non-target cells and molecules to the support limits the specificity and resulting purity of traditional separation methods. Herein we describe a buoyant-antigen-magnetic (BAM) separation approach to increase specificity using two distinct separation processes with \"AND\" logic. Buoyant silica microbubbles and magnetic microbeads, each with their own antibody, bind to the target cell forming a BAM sandwich complex which can be separated from non-targeted cells (which are neither magnetic nor buoyant), as well as from cells bound to only single buoyant or magnetic microparticles but not both. Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogenic bacteria that can contaminate food products, was used as a model organism to establish a nearly 100-fold reduction in the non-specific carryover of non-target Escherichia coli bacteria in comparison to simple magnetic separation. Beads with no attached analyte were also removed. Furthermore, the BAM complexes could be visualized by eye (or camera) providing a rapid and sensitive method for pathogenic bacterial detection. Bacterial concentrations as low as 5 x 104 CFU/ml were evident by eye and could easily be distinguished from non-target S. aureus bacteria even at much higher concentrations (5x107 cfu/mL). This approach enabled simple user-friendly measurement for on-site detection and isolation without expensive equipment.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517249v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b5eb3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16672f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105221aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f948_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "Bromodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural motifs that recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. They play a crucial role in shaping chromatin architecture and regulating gene expression in various biological processes. Mutations in bromodomains containing proteins leads to multiple human diseases, which makes them attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Extensive studies have been done on BRD4 as a target for several cancers, such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Burkitt Lymphoma. Several potential inhibitors have been identified against the BRD4 bromodomain. However, most of these inhibitors have drawbacks such as nonspecificity and toxicity, decreasing their appeal and necessitating the search for novel non-toxic inhibitors. This study aims to address this need by virtually screening natural compounds from the NPASS database against the Kac binding site of BRD4-BD1 using high throughput molecular docking followed by similarity clustering, pharmacokinetic screening, MD simulation, and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations. Using this approach, we identified five natural product inhibitors having a similar or better binding affinity to the BRD4 bromodomain compared to JQ1 (previously reported inhibitor of BRD4). Further systematic analysis of these inhibitors resulted in the top three hits: NPC268484 (Palodesangren-B), NPC295021 (Candidine), and NPC313112 (Buxifoliadine-D). Collectively, our in silico results identified some promising natural products that have the potential to act as potent BRD4-BD1 inhibitors and can be considered for further validation through future in vitro and in vivo studies."

Cytb has eight transmembrane helices containing two hemes b for electron transfer. Cbp3 and Cbp6 assist Cytb synthesis, and together with Cbp4 induce Cytb hemylation. Subunits Qcr7/Qcr8 participate in the first steps of assembly, and lack of Qcr7 reduces Cytb synthesis through an assembly-feedback mechanism involving Cbp3/Cbp6. Since Qcr7 resides near the Cytb carboxyl-region, we wondered whether this region is important for Cytb synthesis/assembly. Although deletion of the Cytb C-region did not abrogate Cytb synthesis, the assembly-feedback regulation was lost, so Cytb synthesis was normal even if Qcr7 was missing. Mutants lacking the Cytb C-terminus were non-respiratory due to absence of fully assembled bc1 complex. By performing complexome profiling, we showed the existence of aberrant early-stage subassemblies in the mutant. In this work we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of Cytb is critical for regulation of Cytb synthesis and bc1 complex assembly."

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution is a global threat and affects almost every marine ecosystem. The amount of plastic in the ocean has increased substantially over the past decade, posing a mounting threat to biodiversity. Seabirds, typically top predators in marine food chains, have been negatively affected by plastic pollution. Here we focused on documenting the sublethal effects of plastic in Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica, WTSH) on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Through analyses of blood chemistry, gene expression, morphometrics and stomach contents, we documented the effects of plastic ingestion on adult WTHS from 3 established colonies. We detected a negative relationship between body weight and the presence of plastic in regurgitated stomach contents. Genes associated with metabolic, biosynthetic pathways, inflammatory responses and ribosome function were upregulated in lighter birds. Birds that had ingested plastic tended to be lighter in weight, in comparison to birds that did not have plastic and tended to weight more. Furthermore, there were 43 genes differentiating males and females that did not have plastic compared to only 11 genes differentiating males and females that had ingested plastic. There was also a marginal negative relationship between lighter birds and blood urea nitrogen levels. We also hope that the morphometric measurements, blood parameters and gene expression data we collected contributes to a database that will be used for future studies on understanding anthropogenic effects on seabird body condition."

    "abstract": "Sesame is an ancient oilseed crop containing many valuable nutritional components. Recently, the demand for sesame seeds and their products has increased worldwide, making it necessary to enhance the development of high-yielding cultivars. One approach to enhance genetic gain in breeding programs is genomic selection. However, studies on genomic selection and genomic prediction in sesame are limited. In this study, we performed genomic prediction for agronomic traits using the phenotypes and genotypes of a sesame diversity panel grown under Mediterranean climatic conditions over two growing seasons. We aimed to assess the accuracy of prediction for nine important agronomic traits in sesame using single- and multi-environment analyses. In single-environment analysis, genomic best linear unbiased prediction, BayesB, BayesC, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces models showed no substantial differences. The average prediction accuracy of the nine traits across these models ranged from 0.39-0.79 for both growing seasons. In the multi-environment analysis, the marker-by-environment interaction model, which decomposed the marker effects into components shared across environments and environment-specific deviations, improved the prediction accuracies for all traits by 15%-58% compared to the single-environment model, particularly when borrowing information from other environments was made possible. Our results showed that single-environment analysis produced moderate-to-high genomic prediction accuracy for agronomic traits in sesame. The multi-environment analysis further enhanced this accuracy by exploiting marker-by-environment interaction. We concluded that genomic prediction using multi-environmental trial data could improve efforts for breeding cultivars adapted to the semi-arid Mediterranean climate."

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins involved in diverse cellular signaling processes and consequently serve as crucial drug targets. Here, we carry out the first large-scale ensemble thermodynamic study of 45 different ligand-free GPCRs employing a structure-based statistical mechanical framework and identify extensive conformational plasticity encompassing the seven transmembrane (TM) helices. Multiple partially structured states or intermediates co-exist in equilibrium in the native ensemble, with the TM helices 1, 6 and 7 displaying varied degrees of structure, and TM3 exhibiting the maximal stability. Active state GPCRs are characterized by reduced conformational heterogeneity with altered coupling-patterns distributed not just locally but throughout the structural scaffold. Strongly coupled residues are distributed across the structure in an anisotropic manner accounting for only 13% of the residues, highlighting that a large number of residues in GPCRs are inherently dynamic to enable structural motions critical for function. Our work thus uncovers the thermodynamic hallmarks of GPCR structure and activation, and how differences quantifiable only via higher-order coupling free energies provide insights into their exquisite structural specialization and the fluid nature of the intramolecular interaction network. The intricate landscapes and perturbation methodologies presented here lay the foundation for understanding allosteric mechanisms in GPCRs, location of structural-functional hot-spots, and effects of disease-causing mutations."

    "abstract": "16S rRNA is a commonly used technique to identify prokaryotes. However, this approach could only reflect the proportion of sequencing reads, instead of actual cell fraction. To accurately represent actual cell fraction, bioinformatic tools that estimate 16S gene copy number (GCN) of unmeasured species are required. All the existing tools rely on taxonomy or phylogeny to predict 16S GCN. The present study develops a deep learning-based method that establishes a novel route. The proposed approach, i.e., Artificial Neural Network Approximator for 16S rRNA Gene Copy Number (ANNA16), essentially links 16S sequence string directly to GCN, without the construction of taxonomy or phylogeny. The computational analysis revealed the success of the deep learning model built on 16S GCN data retrieved from rrnDB (N = 19,520). The resulting deep learning model outperforms all the major and state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) shows ANNA16 is capable of detecting informative positions and weighing K-mers unequally according to their informativeness to more effectively utilize the information contained in 16S sequence. For the accessibility of ANNA16, it will be released as a public, an end-to-end, web-based tool that predicts copy number from 16S rRNA sequence."

Recent spatial profiling studies have mostly charted genetic and RNA variation in tumors separately. To leverage the potential of RNA to identify copy number alterations (CNAs), we developed SlideCNA, a computational tool to extract sparse spatial CNA signals from spatial transcriptomics data, using expression-aware spatial binning. We test SlideCNA on simulated and real Slide-seq data of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and demonstrate its potential for spatial sub-clone detection."

    "abstract": "Insufficient insulin secretion to meet metabolic demand results in diabetes. The intracellular flux of Ca2+ into {beta}-cells triggers insulin release. Since genetics strongly influences variation in islet secretory responses, we surveyed islet Ca2+ dynamics in eight genetically diverse mouse strains. We found high strain variation in response to four conditions: 1) 8 mM glucose; 2) 8 mM glucose plus amino acids; 3) 8 mM glucose, amino acids, plus 10nM GIP; and 4) 2 mM glucose. These stimuli interrogate {beta}-cell function, -cell to {beta}-cell signaling, and incretin responses. We then correlated components of the Ca2+ waveforms to islet protein abundances in the same strains used for the Ca2+ measurements. To focus on proteins relevant to human islet function, we identified human orthologues of correlated mouse proteins that are proximal to glycemic-associated SNPs in human GWAS. Several orthologues have previously been shown to regulate insulin secretion (e.g. ABCC8, PCSK1, and GCK), supporting our mouse-to-human integration as a discovery platform. By integrating these data, we nominated novel regulators of islet Ca2+ oscillations and insulin secretion with potential relevance for human islet function. We also provide data for identifying appropriate mouse strains in which to study these regulators."

    "abstract": "The neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with promise as a drug target for the treatment of pain, schizophrenia, obesity, addiction, and various cancers. A detailed picture of the NTS1 structural landscape has been established by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and yet, the molecular determinants for why a receptor couples to G protein versus arrestin transducers remain poorly defined. We used 13C{varepsilon}H3-methionine NMR spectroscopy to show that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) promotes transducer complexation not by dramatically altering the receptor structure but by strengthening long-range allosteric connections, in the form of correlated conformational kinetics, between the orthosteric pocket and highly-conserved activation motifs. {beta}-arrestin-1 further remodels the receptor ensemble by reducing conformational exchange kinetics for a subset of resonances, whereas G protein coupling has little to no effect on the rate. A {beta}-arrestin biased allosteric modulator transforms the NTS1:G protein complex into a concatenation of substates, without triggering transducer dissociation, suggesting that it may function by stabilizing signaling incompetent G protein conformations such as the non-canonical state. Together, our work demonstrates the importance of kinetic information to a complete picture of the GPCR activation landscape."

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic reintroduction can supplement natural recolonisation in reestablishing a species distribution and abundance. However, both reintroductions and recolonisations can give rise to population bottlenecks that reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding, potentially causing accumulation of genetic load and reduced fitness. Most current populations of the endemic high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) originate from recent reintroductions or recolonisations following regional extirpations due to past overharvesting. We investigated and compared the genomic consequences of these two paths to reestablishment using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 100 Svalbard reindeer across their range. We found little admixture between reintroduced and natural populations. Two reintroduced populations, each founded by 12 individuals around four decades (i.e. 8 reindeer generations) ago, formed two distinct genetic clusters. Compared to the source population, these populations showed only small decreases in genome-wide heterozygosity and increases in inbreeding and lengths of runs of homozygosity. In contrast, the two naturally recolonised populations without admixture possessed much lower heterozygosity, higher inbreeding, and longer runs of homozygosity, possibly caused by serial population bottlenecks and/or fewer or more genetically related founders than in the reintroduction events. Naturally recolonised populations can thus be more vulnerable to the accumulation of genetic load than reintroduced populations. This suggests that in some organisms even small-scale reintroduction programs based on genetically diverse source populations can be more effective than natural recolonisation in establishing genetically diverse populations. These findings warrant particular attention in the conservation and management of populations and species threatened by habitat fragmentation and loss."

    "abstract": "Conservation genomic studies in non-model organisms generally rely on genome reduction techniques based on restriction enzymes to identify population structure as well as candidate loci for local adaptation. These reduced libraries ensure a high density of SNP loci and high coverage for accurate genotyping. Despite the fraction of the genome that is sequenced is expected to be randomly located, the reduction of the genome might depend on the recognition site of the restriction enzyme used. Here, we evaluate the distribution and functional composition of loci obtained after Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) genome reduction with two widely used restriction enzymes (EcoT22I and ApeKI). To do so, we compared data from two endemic fish species (Symphodus ocellatus and Symphodus tinca, EcoT22I enzyme) and two ecosystem engineer sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, ApeKI enzyme). In brief, we mapped the sequenced loci to the phylogenetically closest reference genome available (Labrus bergylta for fish and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus for sea urchins), classified them as exonic, intronic, and intergenic, and studied their functionality by using GO terms. We detected an enrichment towards exonic or intergenic regions depending on the restriction enzyme used, and we did not detect differences between total loci and candidate loci for adaptation. Despite most GO terms being shared between species, the analysis of their abundance showed differences between taxonomic groups, which may be attributed to differences of the targeted loci. Our results highlight the importance of restriction enzyme selection and the need for high-quality annotated genomes in conservation genomic studies."

    "abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) is used in many animal and plant breeding programs to enhance genetic gain for complex traits. However, its optimal integration in clone breeding programs that up to now relied on phenotypic selection (PS) requires further research. The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate under a fixed budget how the weight of GS relative to PS, the stage of implementing GS, the correlation between an auxiliary trait assessed in early generations and the target trait, the variance components, and the prediction accuracy affect the genetic gain of the target trait of GS compared to PS, (ii) determine the optimal allocation of resources maximizing the genetic gain of the target trait in each selection strategy and for varying cost scenarios, and (iii) make recommendations to breeders how to implement GS in clone and especially potato breeding programs. In our simulation results, any selection strategy involving GS had a higher short-term genetic gain for the target trait than Standard-PS. In addition, we show that implementing GS in consecutive selection stages can largely enhance short-term genetic gain and recommend the breeders to implement GS at single hills and A clone stages. Furthermore, we observed for selection strategies involving GS that the optimal allocation of resources maximizing the genetic gain of the target trait differed considerably from those typically used in potato breeding programs. Therefore, our study provides new insight for breeders regarding how to optimally implement GS in a commercial potato breeding program to improve the short-term genetic gain for their target trait."

Macrophages derived from GBA-/-, GBA+/- and GBA+/+ hiPSCs, were compared for GCase enzymatic activity, motility, and phagocytosis, all of which showed that GBA mutation correction restores normal macrophage functions. Furthermore, we investigated whether lysosomal disorders drive susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by infecting GBA-/-, GBA+/- and GBA+/+ macrophages with the virulent H37Rv lab strain. The results showed that impaired mobility and phagocytic activity of Gaucher macrophages, correlated with reduced levels of TB engulfment and TB multiplication, supporting the hypothesis that GD may be protective against tuberculosis."

    "date": "2022-11-26",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Centromeres are chromosomal regions essential for coordinating chromosome segregation during cell division. While centromeres are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant called CENP-A rather than a particular DNA sequence, they are typically embedded in repeat-dense and heterochromatic chromosomal genome regions. In many species, centromeres are associated with transposable elements but it is unclear if these elements are selfish and target centromeres for insertion or if they play a role in centromere specification and function. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to understand the evolution of centromere-associated transposable elements. G2/Jockey-3 is a non-LTR retroelement in the Jockey clade and the only sequence shared by all centromeres. We study the evolution of G2/Jockey-3 using short and long read population genomic data to infer insertion polymorphisms across the genome. We combine estimates of the age, frequency, and location of insertions to infer the evolutionary processes shaping G2/Jockey-3 and its association with the centromeres. We find that G2/Jockey-3 is an active retroelement that is targeted by the piRNA pathway. Our results suggest that G2-Jockey-3 is highly enriched in centromeres at least in part due to an insertion bias. We do not detect any signature of positive selection on any G2/Jockey-3 insertions that would suggest than individual insertions are favored by natural selection. Instead, we infer that most insertions are neutral or weakly deleterious both inside and outside of the centromeres. Therefore, G2/Jockey-3 evolution is consistent with it being a selfish genetic element that targets centromeres. We suspect targeting centromeres for insertion helps active retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 escape host defenses, as the unique centromeric chromatin may prevent targeting by the host silencing machinery. On the other hand, centromeric TEs insertions may be tolerated or even beneficial if they also contribute to the right transcriptional and chromatin environment. Thus, we suspect centromere-associated retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 reflect a balance between conflict and cooperation at the centromeres."

    "abstract": "A key and unresolved question in aging research is how to quantify aging at the individual level that led to development of \"aging clocks\", machine learning algorhythms trained to predict individual age from high-dimensional molecular data under the the assumption that individual deviations of the predicted age from the chronological age contain information on the individual condition (often referred to as \"biological age\"). A full validation of such clocks as biomarkers for clinical studies of ageing would require a comparison of their predictions with information on actual lifespan and long-term health. Such studies take decades in humans, but could be conducted in a much shorter time-frame in animal models. We developed a transcriptomic clock in the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri. This species is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be cultured in captivity and is an emerging model organism for genetic and experimental studies on aging. We developed a proprietary deep learning architecture that autonomously selects a customizable number of input genes to use for its predictions in order to reduce overfitting and increase interpretability, and adopts an adversarial learning framework to identify tissue-independent transcriptional patterns. We called this architecture the Selective Adversarial Deep Neural Network (SA-DNN) and trained it on a multi-tissue transcriptomic dataset of N. furzeri. This SA-DNN predicted age of the test set with an accuracy of 1 day, i.e. less than 1% of the total species lifespan and detected genetic, pharmacological and environmental interventions that are known to influence lifespan in this species. Finally, a human transcriptomic multi-tissue clock that uses as input the orthologs of the genes selected by our SA-DNN in N. furzeri reaches an average error of[~] 3 years rivalling epigenetic clocks. Our SA-DNN represents the prototype of a new class of aging clocks that provide biomarkers applicable to intervention studies in model organisms and humans."

A crystal structure of the three C-terminal RNA binding cold-shock domains (CSD) of Unr bound to a poly(A) sequence exemplifies how recognition goes beyond the classical {pi}-{pi}-stacking in CSDs. Further structural studies reveal several interaction surfaces between the N-terminal and C-terminal part of Unr with the poly(A)-binding protein (pAbp). This provides first atomistic details towards understanding regulation of translation initiation that is mediated by the interplay of these two proteins with each other and RNA."

The increase in the viscosity as a function of the cell area fraction ({phi}) follows the behavior familiar in glass forming systems but the saturation at high{phi} is a surprise, especially in a living system. To determine the mechanism of this unexpected behavior of viscosity, we perform extensive simulations using an agent-based model of a dense non-confluent two-dimensional tissue. We show that polydispersity in the cell size, and the propensity of the cells to deform, results in the available free area per cell to saturate beyond a critical density. Saturation in the free space not only explains the viscosity plateau but also links equilibrium geometrical packing to dramatic increase in the relaxation dynamics."

These transitions in turn generate both long ranged and long lived clockwise and anticlockwise vortices, which gives rise to turbulent-like flows. Both experiments and simulations show that at long wavelengths the wave vector (k) dependent energy spectrum E(k) {approx} k-5/3, coinciding with the Kolmogorov scaling in fully developed inertial turbulence.

    "abstract": "Prions represent epigenetic regulator proteins that can self-propagate their structure and confer their misfolded structure and function on normally folded proteins. Like the mammalian prion PrPSc, prions also occur in fungi. While a few prions, like Swi1, affect gene expression, none are shown to affect heterochromatin structure and function. In fission yeast and metazoans, histone methyltransferase Clr4/Suv39 causes H3-Lys9 methylation, which is bound by the chromodomain protein Swi6/HP1 to assemble heterochromatin. Earlier, we showed that sng2-1 mutation in the Cut4 subunit of Anaphase Promoting Complex abrogates heterochromatin structure due to defective binding and recruitment of Swi6. Here, we demonstrate that the Cut4p forms a non-canonical prion form, designated as [SNG2], which abrogates heterochromatin silencing. [SNG2] exhibits various prion-like properties, e.g., non-Mendelian inheritance, requirement of Hsp proteins for its propagation, de novo generation upon cut4 overexpression, reversible curing by guanidine, cytoplasmic inheritance and formation of infectious protein aggregates, which are converted into monomers upon overexpression of hsp genes. Interestingly, [SNG2] prion imparts an enhanced tolerance to stress conditions, supporting its role in promoting cell survival under environmental stress during evolution."

Sequence variants in enhancers have been implicated in disease, however establishing the functional consequences of these variants is challenging due to a lack of understanding of precise cell types and developmental stages where the enhancers are normally active. PAX6 is the master regulator of eye development, and has a regulatory landscape containing multiple enhancers driving expression in the eye. Whether these enhancers perform additive, redundant, or distinct functions is unknown. Here we describe the precise cell types and regulatory activity of two PAX6 retinal enhancers, HS5 and NRE. Using a unique combination of live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing in dual enhancer-reporter zebrafish embryos, we find significant differences in the spatiotemporal activity of these enhancers, and show that HS5 and NRE are active in distinct cell types of the developing retina. Our results show that although overlapping, these enhancers have distinct activities in different cell types and therefore likely non-redundant functions. This work demonstrates that unique cell type-specific functions can be uncovered for apparently similar enhancers when investigated at high resolution in vivo."

Therefore, in the present study, we used C. elegans to model this primary microcephaly associated mutation to determine which molecular pathways are affected by this mutation in C. elegans. The human primary microcephaly-associated mutation corresponds to SAS-6(L69T) in C. elegans. Our studies revealed that both centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis are perturbed by the sas-6(L69T) mutation. Specifically, C. elegans carrying the sas-6(L69T) mutation exhibit an increased failure of centrosome duplication in a sensitized genetic background. Further, worms carrying this mutation also display shortened phasmid cilia, an abnormal phasmid cilia morphology, defective phasmid dendrite morphology and chemotaxis defects. Our data show that the centrosome duplication defects caused by this mutation are only uncovered in a sensitized genetic background, indicating that these defects are mild. However, the ciliogenesis defects caused by this mutation are evident in an otherwise wild-type background, indicating that they are stronger defects. Based on our findings, we propose that the ciliogenesis defects induced by this mutation are likely a more important contributing factor to the development of primary microcephaly in humans carrying this mutation than centrosome duplication defects. Thus, our studies shed light on a novel mechanism by which the sas-6(L69T) mutation could lead to the incidence of primary microcephaly in humans."

    "abstract": "Treatment of parasitic nematode infections in humans and livestock relies on a small arsenal of anthelmintic drugs that have historically reduced parasite burdens. However, anthelmintic resistance (AR) is increasing, and little is known about the molecular and genetic causes of resistance for most drugs. The free-living roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a tractable model to understand AR, where studies have led to the identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse C. elegans strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains displayed significant variation in anthelmintic responses across drug classes. Dose-response trends within a drug class showed that the C. elegans strains elicited similar responses within the benzimidazoles but variable responses in the macrocyclic lactones and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. Next, we compared the effective concentration estimates to induce a 10% maximal response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve of each strain to the reference strain, N2, which enabled the identification of anthelmintics with population-wide differences to understand how genetics contribute to AR. Because genetically diverse strains displayed differential susceptibilities within and across anthelmintics, we show that C. elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides. Third, we quantified the heritability of responses to each anthelmintic and observed a significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. Heritable genetic variation can be explained by strain-specific anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. These results suggest drugs to prioritize in genome-wide association studies, which will enable the identification of AR genes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYParasitic nematodes infect most animal species and significantly impact human and animal health. Control of parasitic nematodes in host species relies on a limited collection of anthelmintic drugs. However, anthelmintic resistance is widespread, which threatens our ability to control parasitic nematode populations. Here, we used the non-parasitic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study anthelmintic resistance across 26 anthelmintics that span ten drug classes. We leveraged the genetic diversity of C. elegans to quantify anthelmintic responses across a range of doses, estimate dose-response curves, fit strain-specific model parameters, and calculate the contributions of genetics to these parameters. We found that genetic variation within a species plays a considerable role in anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. Our results emphasize how the incorporation of genetically diverse C. elegans strains is necessary to understand anthelmintic response variation found in natural populations. These results highlight drugs to prioritize in future mapping studies to identify genes involved in anthelmintic resistance.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518036v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59765forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a7e22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eecf5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6d24f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "Facultative heterochromatin controls development and differentiation in many eukaryotes. In metazoans, plants, and many filamentous fungi, facultative heterochromatin is characterized by transcriptional repression and enrichment with nucleosomes that are trimethylated at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion of kmt5, the gene encoding the sole methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 methylation, resulted in global derepression of transcription, especially in regions of facultative heterochromatin. This finding explains our previous results where loss of H3K27me3 in kmt6 deletion strains alone was insufficient to alleviate transcriptional silencing in the same regions. Reversal of silencing in the absence of H4K20me3 not only affected genes but also a large number of novel, previously undetected, non-coding transcripts generated from regions of facultative heterochromatin on accessory chromosomes. Transcriptional activation in kmt5 deletion strains was accompanied by a complete loss of Ash1-mediated H3K36me3 and chromatin reorganization affecting H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 distribution in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Strains with a H4K20M mutation in the single histone H4 gene of Z. tritici recapitulated these chromatin changes, suggesting that H4K20me3 is essential for Ash1-mediated H3K36me3. The {Delta}kmt5 mutants we obtained are more sensitive to genotoxic stressors and both, {Delta}kmt5 and {Delta}ash1, showed a greatly increased rate of accessory chromosome losses. Taken together, our results provide insights into a novel, and unsuspected, mechanism controlling the assembly and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "At each cell division, nanometer-scale components self-organize to build a micron-scale spindle. In mammalian spindles, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers attach to chromosomes and focus into spindle poles. Despite evidence suggesting that poles can set spindle length, their role remains poorly understood. In fact, many species do not have spindle poles. Here, we probe the poles contribution to mammalian spindle length, dynamics, and function by inhibiting dynein to generate spindles whose kinetochore-fibers do not focus into poles, yet maintain a metaphase steady-state length. We find that unfocused kinetochore-fibers have a mean length indistinguishable from control, but a broader length distribution, and reduced length coordination between sisters and neighbors. Further, we show that unfocused kinetochore-fibers, like control, can grow back to their steady-state length if acutely shortened by drug treatment or laser ablation: they recover their length by tuning their end dynamics, albeit slower due to their reduced baseline dynamics. Thus, kinetochore-fiber dynamics are regulated by their length, not just pole-focusing forces. Finally, we show that spindles with unfocused kinetochore-fibers can segregate chromosomes but fail to correctly do so. We propose that mammalian spindle length emerges locally from individual k-fibers while spindle poles globally coordinate k-fibers across space and time."

    "abstract": "The GTPase Rab14 is localized at the trans-Golgi network and at the intermediate compartment associated to sorting/recycling endosomes-like structures of the transferrin-recycling pathway: as other Rab family members, it is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking, though its role and functional relationship with effector/endosomal proteins is still incomplete.\n\nWe have analysed whether post-translational modifications could affect Rab14 activity: the results obtained define mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) as the yet-unknown Rab14 modification, catalysed by the ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP12, which specifically modifies glutamic acid residues in position 159/162. This modification is essential for the Rab14-dependent endosome progression. Accordingly, recycling of the transferrin receptor is inhibited when MARylation of Rab14 is prevented by PARP12 knocking-down or inhibition, or by overexpression of Rab14 ADP-ribosylation-defective mutant. Under these conditions, Rab14 and transferrin receptors are withheld at the cell periphery at the level of the Rab4-RUFY1-positive sorting endosomes, indicating that the interaction of Rab14 with the dual effectors RUFY and then FIP1c (which specifically binds both Rab11 and Rab14) determines the progression between the Rab4-RUFY- and Rab11-FIP1c-specific vesicles. Therefore Rab14-MARylation determines the sequential binding of this GTPase to RUFY and FIP1c, thus controlling endosome progression (i.e., transferrin receptors recycling) through the Rab4-, Rab14- and Rab11-specific vesicles. This identifies a Rab14-specific compartment of the recycling pathway and a crucial enzymatic reaction amenable to pharmacological control."

    "abstract": "Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes arteriovenous vascular malformations (AVMs) in different organs, including the lung. Three genes, ENG (endoglin), ACVRL1 (ALK1) and SMAD4, all members of the TGF-{beta}/BMPR2 signaling pathway, are responsible for over 85% of all HHT cases. However, how these loss-of-function gene mutations lead to AVMs formation and what common downstream signaling they target is unknown. Here, using a combination of siRNA-mediated gene silencing, whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, transcriptomic-based drug discovery, endothelial cells functional assays and VEGF signaling analysis, and ex vivo precision cut lung slice (PCLS) cultures approach, we uncovered common downstream transcriptomic gene signatures of HHT-casing genes and identified promising drug for HHT. We found the commonly used BMPR2-signaling downstream target ID1 is not a common downstream target of all the three HHT genes knockdown in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). We identified novel common downstream targets of all the three HHT-causing genes that were enriched for HHT-related biological process and signaling pathways. Among those downstream genes, LYVE1, GPNMB, and MC5R were strong downstream targets that could serve as a better common downstream target than ID1. Furthermore, using the common downstream upregulated genes (HHT disease signature) following HHT gene knockdown, we identified a small molecule drug, Brivanib, that reversed the HHT disease signature, and inhibited VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and angiogenesis in PMVECs and inhibited some of the upregulated HHT disease genes in PCLS. Our findings suggest that Brivanib could be an emerging new drug for HHT."

    "abstract": "Protein folding, refolding and disaggregation are facilitated by the binding and releasing activity of HSP70 proteins. Such activity is aided by J-domain proteins (JDPs, DNAJs or HSP40s) that stimulate the ATPase activity of HSP70 and stabilize complexes between HSP70 and nonnative proteins. The C-terminus EEVD motif of HSP70 interacts with client proteins and with JDPs. Deletion of the EEVD disrupts the ability of HSP70 to associate with class B JDPs. A new understanding of the EEVD interaction with a JDP arises from the results of this work, which gives a detailed NMR characterization of the dynamics and interaction between a class B JDP, Sis1, and the HSP70-EEVD. The EEVD motif binds to multiple sites in Sis1. The interactions at CTDI contribute to the anchoring of HSP70 to Sis1, at site I, and the displacement of the client protein at site II. The competing interaction between the J-domain and the N-terminal boundary of -helix 6 (at the GF-region) contributes to the interaction of J-domain to HSP70. These results support a mechanism involved in the regulation of the interaction with HSP70 that is autoinhibitory. Finally, a detailed model of the interaction of the EEVD with the J-domain of Sis1 is proposed."

Understanding the transcriptional landscape long after irradiation treatment that results in chronic salivary hypofunction will help identify injury mechanisms and develop regenerative therapies to address this need. Advances in single cell (sc)RNAseq have made it possible to identify previously uncharacterized cell types within tissues and to uncover gene regulatory networks that mediate cell-cell communication and drive specific cell states. scRNAseq studies have been performed for virtually all major tissues including salivary glands; however, there are currently no scRNAseq studies the long-term chronic effects of irradiation on salivary glands. Here, we present scRNAseq from control and irradiated murine parotid glands collected 10 months post-irradiation. We identify a previously uncharacterized population of epithelial cells in the gland defined by expression of Etv1, which may be an acinar cell precursor. These Etv1+ cells also express Ntrk2 and Erbb3 and thus may respond to myoepithelial cell-derived growth factor ligands. Furthermore, our data suggests that CD8+ T-cells and secretory cells are the most transcriptionally affected during chronic injury with radiation, suggesting active immune involvement during chronic injury post-irradiation. Thus, our study provides a resource to understand the transcriptional landscape in a chronic post-irradiation microenvironment and identifies cell-specific pathways that may be targeted to repair chronic damage.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe generated a scRNAseq dataset of chronic post-irradiation injury in parotid glands\nC_LIO_LIA newly identified Etv1+ epithelial population may be acinar precursors\nC_LIO_LINtrk2 and Erbb3 are highly specific Etv1+ cell receptors that may mediate cell-cell communication with myoepithelial cells\nC_LIO_LICD8+ T-cells and secretory acinar cells have the greatest transcriptional changes post-IR\nC_LI"

The urea buffer combined with ultrasonication (UA_ultrasonication) produced the highest protein extraction rate, leading to the deepest coverage of human sperm proteome (5685 protein groups) from healthy human sperm samples. Since the antibiotics, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, have been widely used against H. pylori infection, we conduct a longitudinal study of sperm proteome via data-independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry (DIA-MS/MS) on an infected patient during on and off therapy with these two drugs. The semen examination and morphological analysis were performed combined with proteomics analysis. Our results indicated that antibiotics may cause an increase in the sperm concentration and the rate of malformed sperm and disrupt proteome expression in sperm.

The reliable quantification of these rates is thus essential to understand how protein levels are regulated. While several studies have quantified the contribution of different steps of gene expression in regulating protein levels, these are limited by the use of equilibrium approximations when studying out-of-equilibrium biological systems. Here we introduce flux analysis to quantify the contribution of gene expression steps to regulate the dynamics of the expression level for specific proteins. We use flux analysis to analyze a published RNA-seq and proteomics dataset of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs stimulated with LPS. Our analysis revealed six regulatory modalities shared by sets of genes with clear functional signatures. We also find that protein degradation plays a stronger role than expected in the adaptation of protein levels to LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that shared regulatory strategies can lead to versatile responses at the protein level and highlight the importance of going beyond steady-state approximations to uncover the dynamic contribution of different steps of gene expression to protein levels."

    "abstract": "Human corneal endothelial cells are organized in a tight mosaic of hexagonal cells and serve a critical function in maintaining corneal hydration and clear vision. Regeneration of the corneal endothelial tissue is hampered by its poor proliferative capacity, which is partially retrieved in vitro, albeit only for a limited number of passages before the cells undergo mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Although different culture conditions have been proposed in order to delay this process and prolong the number of cell passages, EnMT has still not been fully understood and successfully counteracted. In this perspective, we identified herein a single GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, able to revert and avoid EnMT in primary human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs) from old donors until late passages in vitro (P8), as shown from cell morphology analysis (circularity). In accordance, CHIR99021 reduced expression of -SMA, an EnMT marker, while restored endothelial markers such as ZO-1, Na+/K+ ATPase and N-cadherin, without increasing cell proliferation. A further analysis on RNA expression confirmed CHIR99021 induced downregulation of EnMT markers (SMA and CD44), upregulation of the proliferation repressor p21 and revealed novel insights into the {beta}-catenin and TGF{beta} pathways intersections in HCEnCs. The use of CHIR99021 sheds light on the mechanisms involved in EnMT and brings a substantial advantage in maintaining primary HCEnCs in culture until late passages, while preserving the correct morphology and phenotype. Altogether, these results bring crucial advancements towards the improvement of the corneal endothelial cells based therapy."

This study aimed at estimating the prevalence and genetic diversity of Wolbachia in different mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) species from Cape Verde.\n\nMethodsMosquitoes were collected in six islands of Cape Verde using dippers/pipettes, BG-sentinel(R) traps, CDC light traps, and dorsal aspirators. Samples were identified to species using morphological keys and PCR-based molecular assays. Wolbachia was detected by amplifying a fragment of the surface protein gene (wsp). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed with five housekeeping genes (coxA, gatB, ftsZ, hcpA and fbpA) and the wsp hypervariable region (HVR) for strain identification. Identification of wPip groups (wPip-I to wPip-V) was performed using PCR-RFLP assay on the ankyrin-domain gene pk1.\n\nResultsNine mosquito species were collected, including the major vectors Aedes aegypti, Anopheles arabiensis, Culex pipiens s.s. and Culex quinquefasciatus. Wolbachia was detected in Cx. pipiens s.s. (100% prevalence), Cx. quinquefasciatus (98.3%), Cx. pipiens/quinquefasciatus hybrids (100%) and Culex tigripes (100%). Results from MLST and wsp hypervariable region typing showed that Wolbachia from Cx. pipiens s.l. belong to Sequence Type 9, wPip clade and supergroup B Wolbachia. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Wolbachia isolated from Cx. tigripes belongs to Supergroup B but integrates a distinct clade from wPip with no attributed MLST profile. PCR-RFLP revealed wPip-II, wPip-III and wPip-IV groups in Culex pipiens s.l. wPip-IV was the dominant group, while wPip-II and wPip-III were restricted to Maio and Fogo islands, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur study showed a high prevalence and diversity of Wolbachia in Cx pipiens s.l. from Cape Verde islands and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to detect Wolbachia in Cx. tigripes, being represented in this species by a previously undescribed MLST Sequence Type."

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that cis-regulatory elements controlling gene expression may be the predominant target of natural selection in humans and other species. Detecting selection acting on these elements is critical to understanding evolution but remains challenging because we do not know which mutations will affect gene regulation. To address this, we devised an approach to search for lineage-specific selection on chromatin activity, transcription factor binding, and chromosomal looping--critical steps in transcriptional regulation. Applying this approach to lymphoblastoid cells from 831 individuals of either European or African descent, we find strong signals of differential chromatin activity linked to gene expression differences between ancestries in numerous contexts, but no evidence of functional differences in chromosomal looping. Moreover, we show that enhancers rather than promoters display the strongest signs of selection associated with sites of differential transcription factor binding. Overall, our study indicates that some cis-regulatory adaptation may be more easily detected at the level of chromatin than DNA sequence. This work provides a vast resource of genomic interaction data from diverse human populations and establishes a novel selection test that will benefit future study of regulatory evolution in humans and other species."

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop and its genome is one of the largest ever assembled at reference-quality level. It is 15 Gb, hexaploid, with 85% of transposable elements (TEs). Wheat genetic diversity was mainly focused on genes and little is known about the extent of genomic variability affecting TEs, transposition rate, and the impact of polyploidy. Multiple chromosome-scale assemblies are now available for bread wheat and for its tetraploid and diploid wild relatives. In this study, we computed base pair-resolved, gene-anchored, whole genome alignments of A, B, and D lineages at different ploidy levels in order to estimate the variability that affects the TE space. We used assembled genomes of 13 T. aestivum cultivars (6x=AABBDD), T. durum (4x=AABB), T. dicoccoides (4x=AABB), T. urartu (2x=AA), and Aegilops tauschii (2x=DD). We show that 5 to 34% of the TE fraction is variable, depending on the species divergence. Between 400 and 13,000 novel TE insertions per subgenome were detected. We found lineage-specific insertions for nearly all TE families in di- tetra- and hexaploids. No burst of transposition was observed and polyploidization did not trigger any boost of transposition. This study challenges the prevailing idea of wheat TE dynamics and is more in agreement with an equilibrium model of evolution."

    "abstract": "Membrane protein and phospholipid (PL) composition changes in response to environmental cues and during infections. Covalent modification and remodelling of the acyl chain length of PLs is an important bacterial adaptation mechanism. However, little is known about which bacterial pathways are regulated in response to altered PL composition. Here, we showed that P. aeruginosa phospholipase A, PlaF, which modulates membrane PL composition, is important for biofilm biogenesis, and we performed whole-cell quantitative proteomics of P. aeruginosa wild-type and {Delta}plaF biofilms to identify pathways regulated by PlaF. The results revealed profound alterations in the abundance of several two-component systems (TCSs), including accumulation of PprAB, which controls the transition to biofilm. Furthermore, a unique phosphorylation pattern of transcriptional regulators, transporters and metabolic enzymes, as well as differential production of seven proteases, in {Delta}plaF, indicate that PlaF-mediated virulence adaptation involves complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Moreover, proteomics revealed the depletion of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake pathway proteins in {Delta}plaF, which agrees with the decreased concentrations of extracellular pyoverdine and intracellular iron and is likely responsible for its prolonged lag growth phase, presumably due to reduced iron uptake. Conversely, the accumulation of proteins from alternative iron-uptake systems in {Delta}plaF suggests that PlaF may function as a switch between different iron-acquisition pathways. The observation that {Delta}plaF accumulates PL-acyl chain modifying and PL synthesis enzymes reveals novel insights into the role of PlaF for membrane PL homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism by which PlaF simultaneously affects multiple pathways remains to be elucidated, we suggest that PlaF-catalyses the degradation of PLs which then serve as a signal that is amplified by proteins of two-component, phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation systems to elicit the global adaptive response in P. aeruginosa."

    "abstract": "Pesticide resistance relies on a myriad of mechanisms, ranging from single mutations to a complex and polygenic architecture, and it involves mechanisms such as target-site insensitivity, metabolic detoxification, or a combination of these, with either additive or synergistic effects. Several resistance mechanisms against abamectin, a macrocyclic lactone widely used in crop protection, have been reported in the cosmopolitan pest Tetranychus urticae. However, it has been shown that a single mechanism cannot account for the high levels of abamectin resistance found across different mite populations. Here, we used experimental evolution combined with bulked segregant analyses to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with abamectin resistance in two genetically unrelated strains of T. urticae. In these two independent QTL mapping experiments, three and four QTLs were identified, of which three were shared between experiments. Shared QTLs contained genes encoding subunits of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) and harboured previously reported mutations, including G314D in GluCl1 and G326E in GluCl3, but also novel resistance candidate loci, including DNA helicases and chemosensory receptors. Surprisingly, the fourth QTL, present only in only one of the experiments and thus unique for one parental resistant strain, revealed a non-functional variant of GluCl2, suggesting gene knock-out as resistance mechanism. Our study uncovers the complex basis of abamectin resistance, and it highlights the intraspecific diversity of genetic mechanisms underlying resistance in a cosmopolitan pest."

CRISPRi-FGP applies a build-in database containing 1,300 common prokaryotes as standard designing source, while also accepts customized designing. It employs a scoring metrics based on experiment data, together with specially trimed algorithm for off-target selection both in high quality and speed. CRISPRi-FGP exhibited high accuracy and robustness on sgRNA library designing in multiple prokaryotes. Finally, an experiment comparing CRISPRi-FGP and existing tool was conducted and showed CRISPRi-FGP has improved ability in recognizing off-target sites. All these results showed CRISPRi-FGP with the potential to be a precise and robust tool for high-quality sgRNA library design in prokaryotes."

    "abstract": "Bacterial HflX is a conserved ribosome-binding GTPase involved in splitting ribosomal complexes accumulated under stress condition. However, the atomic details of its ribosomal interaction remain to be elucidated. In this work, we present a high-resolution structure of the E. coli 50S subunit bound with HflX. The structure reveals highly specific contacts between HflX and the ribosomal RNA, and in particular, an insertion loop of the N-terminal domain of HflX is situated in the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and makes direct interactions with PTC residues. Interestingly, this loop displays steric clash with a few PTC-targeting antibiotics on the 50S subunit, such as chloramphenicol. Deletion of hflX results in hypersensitivity to chloramphenicol treatment, and a loop residue G154 of HflX is important for the observed chloramphenicol resistance. Overall, our results suggest that HflX could be a general stress response factor that functions in both stalled ribosome splitting and PTC antibiotic displacing."

    "abstract": "Motility of organisms involves beating of cilia and flagella that are composed of doublet microtubules. The doublets are made of A- and B-tubules that fuse together at two junctions. Among these, the outer junction is made of tripartite tubulin connections, while the inner junction contains distinct non-tubulin elements. The latter includes Flagellar-associated protein 20 (FAP20) and Parkin co-regulated gene protein (PACRG) that together link the A- and B- tubules at the inner junction. While the structures of doublet microtubules reveal molecular details, their assembly is poorly understood and examining proteins at the junctions can provide important clues. In this study, we purified recombinant FAP20 and characterized its effects on microtubule dynamics by TIRF microscopy. Using in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, we conclusively show that FAP20 recruits free tubulin to the existing microtubule, where it mediates flexible lateral interactions between the microtubule lattice and tubulin dimers. Our structure of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex partially resembles the inner junction architecture, further providing insights into assembly steps involved in closure of B- tubule in a doublet microtubule."

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the capture of gene expression heterogeneity and consequently cell-to-cell variability at the cell type level. Although different methods have been proposed to quantify cell-to-cell variability, it is unclear what the optimal statistical approach is, especially in light of challenging data structures that are unique to scRNA-seq data like zero inflation.\n\nResultsIn this study, we conducted a systematic evaluation of cell-to-cell gene expression variability using 14 different variability metrics that are commonly applied to transcriptomic data. Performance was evaluated with respect to data-specific features like sparsity and sequencing platform, biological properties like gene length, and the ability to recapitulate true levels of variability based on simulation and known biological gene sets like ribosomal genes and stably expressed genes. scran had the strongest all-round performance, and this metric was then applied to investigate the changes in cell-to-cell variability that occur during ageing. Studying ageing showcases the value of cell-to-cell variability as it is a genetically-regulated program that is influenced by stochastic processes.scRNA-seq datasets from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and B lymphocytes and other cell types from this differentiation lineage were used with scran to identify the genes with consistent patterns of variable and stable expression profiles during differentiation. Furthermore, to understand the regulatory relationship for genes that were differentially-variable in their expression between young and old mice, we constructed networks using transcription factors and their known targets for HSC and B lymphocyte cells. Comparisons of these networks identified a shared TF Sfpi1 that although was seen to increase in gene expression variability in old mice versus young in both cell types, the corresponding targets were distinct and their gene expression variability had different directions between cell types.\n\nConclusionsThrough these analyses, we highlight the importance of capturing cell-to-cell gene expression variability in a complex biological process like differentiation and ageing, and emphasise the value and specificity of interpreting these findings at the level of individual cell types."

    "abstract": "In droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) assays, systematic contamination of ambient RNA molecules biases the estimation of genuine transcriptional levels. To correct the contamination, several computational methods have been developed. However, these methods do not distinguish the contamination-causing genes and thus either under- or over-corrected the contamination in our in-house snRNA-seq data of virgin and lactating mammary glands. Hence, we developed scCDC as the first method that specifically detects the contamination-causing genes and only corrects the expression counts of these genes. Benchmarked against existing methods on synthetic and real scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets, scCDC achieved the best contamination correction accuracy with minimal data alteration. Moreover, scCDC applies to processed scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data with empty droplets removed. In conclusion, scCDC is a flexible, accurate decontamination method that detects the contamination-causing genes, corrects the contamination, and avoids the over-correction of other genes."

However, deconvolution technology is still in its infancy for the analysis of cell types using proteomic data sets due to challenges with repeatability/reproducibility, variable reference standards and the issues relating to single-cell proteomic reference data sets. Here, we developed a novel deep learning-based deconvolution method (scpDeconv) tailored to single-cell proteomic data sets. scpDeconv uses an autoencoder to leverage the information from bulk proteomic data to improve the quality of single-cell proteomic data, and employs a domain adversarial architecture to bridge the single-cell and bulk data distributions and transfer labels from single-cell data set to bulk data set. Extensive experiments validated the performance of scpDeconv in the deconvolution of proteomic data from various species/sources and produced using different proteomic technologies. This method should find broad applicability to areas including tumor microenvironment interpretation and clinical diagnosis/classification."

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides a useful tool for global surveillance to better understand the evolution and epidemiology of RSV and provide essential information that may impact on antibody treatments, antiviral drug sensitivity and vaccine effectiveness. Here we report the development of a rapid and simplified amplicon-based one-step multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) for WGS of both human RSV-A and RSV-B viruses. The method requires only two reactions for each sample, which significantly reduces the cost and time compared to other commonly used RSV WGS methods. In silico analysis and laboratory testing revealed that the primers used in the new method covered most of the currently circulating RSV-A and RSV-B. Amplicons generated were suitable for both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) NGS platforms. This new method was tested on 200 clinical samples collected in Australia in 2020 and 2021 with RSV Ct values between 10 and 32. A success rate of 88% with a full coverage for the genome of 99 RSV-A and 77 RSV-B was achieved. This assay is simple to set up, robust, easily scalable in sample preparation and relatively inexpensive, and as such, provides a valuable addition to existing NGS RSV WGS methods."

Here, we designed a Odourgenetic system co-expressed Drosophila odorant receptor system (DORs) consisting of OR35a and OR83b, which were exclusively activated by their odor ligand, 2-pentanone. Applying 2-pentanone to DOR-expressing cells or tissues induced calcium influx and membrane depolarization. By inhalation of 2-pentanone, we successfully applied DORs to manipulate behaviour, control insulin secretion and regulate blood glucose and manipulate muscle contraction and associated limb movement. Because 2-pentanone rapidly enters the blood upon inhalation and leaves the body by exhalation, this odorant can be used with DORs to manipulate cellular function, and the manipulation can be terminated at any time. Such feature approach significantly improves the safety and controllability of DORs used in the clinic. Thus, the present study developed a non-invasive, controllable, fast on/off method to manipulate cellular activity and behaviour on a time scale of minutes."

    "abstract": "Cells stabilize intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) to compromise between large biosynthetic needs and detrimental bioenergetic effects of Pi. Pi homeostasis in eukaryotes employs SPXs domains, which are receptors for inositol pyrophosphates. We explored how polymerization and storage of Pi in acidocalcisome-like vacuoles supports S. cerevisiae metabolism and how these cells recognize Pi scarcity. Whereas Pi starvation affects numerous metabolic pathways, beginning Pi scarcity affects few metabolites. These include inositol pyrophosphates and ATP, a low-affinity substrate for inositol pyrophosphate-synthesizing kinases. Declining ATP and inositol pyrophosphates may thus be indicators of impending Pi limitation. Actual Pi starvation triggers accumulation of the purine synthesis intermediate 5- aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), which activates Pi-dependent transcription factors. Cells lacking polyphosphate show Pi starvation features already under Pi-replete conditions, suggesting that vacuolar polyphosphate supplies Pi for metabolism even when Pi is abundant. However, polyphosphate deficiency also generates unique metabolic changes that are not observed in starving wildtype cells. Polyphosphate in acidocalcisome-like vacuoles may hence be more than a global phosphate reserve and channel Pi to preferred cellular processes.\n\nAbstract importanceCells must strike a delicate balance between the high demand of inorganic phosphate (Pi) for synthesizing nucleic acids and phospholipids, and its detrimental bioenergetic effects by reducing the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis. The latter may stall metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms manage the import and export of phosphate, its conversion into osmotically inactive inorganic polyphosphates, and their storage in dedicated organelles, acidocalcisomes. Here, we provide novel insights into metabolic changes that cells may use to signal declining phosphate availability in the cytosol and differentiate it from actual phosphate starvation. We also analyze the role of acidocalcisome-like organelles in phosphate homeostasis. This uncovers an unexpected role of the polyphosphate pool in these organelles under phosphate-rich conditions, indicating that its metabolic roles go beyond that of a phosphate reserve for surviving starvation."

To address this problem, we measured for 99 RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes with 11 nucleotide length in a 1 M NaCl buffer using UV absorbance thermal denaturation. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained by fitting absorbance versus temperature profiles using SciPy non-linear curve fit. A dataset of 228 duplexes were constructed combining with literature experimental thermodynamic parameters for fitting a full set of all 113 possible Watson-Crick and single internal mismatch involving nearest-neighbor parameters using singular value decomposition. The new nearest-neighbor parameters predict thermodynamic parameters of RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes within an average error of 0.26 kcal/mol (3.55%) in free energy at 37{degrees}C ({Delta}G{degrees}37), 5.05 kcal/mol (6.70%) in enthalpy ({Delta}H{degrees}), 16.3 cal/mol{middle dot}K (7.50%) in entropy ({Delta}S{degrees}) and 1.14{degrees}C (2.91%) in melting temperature (Tm). The highest accuracy of all parameters reported. We observed a trend of increased stability for mismatch involving pairs of rG/dT >> rU/dG > rG/dA > rG/dG {approx} rA/dC {approx} rA/dG > rC/dA {approx} rC/dT > rU/dT {approx} rU/dC >> rA/dA >> rC/dC, which can be explained by different hydrogen bond conditions in mismatch pairs. We further compared the stability with RNA/RNA and DNA/DNA duplexes and found a backbone structure depended pattern in these three kinds of nucleic acid duplexes. This nearest-neighbor parameter set could enhance thermodynamical understanding of RNA/DNA combination and have potential usage in predicting on- and off-target RNA-DNA binding activity when applied to biotechnological applications such as CRISPR/Cas systems, RNAi and qPCR."

    "abstract": "Engagement of high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor Fc{varepsilon}RI with extracellular, multivalent antigen (Ag) stabilizes co-existing ordered and disordered phases in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This optimally controls biochemical interactions between signaling components required for transmembrane (TM) signaling in mast cells. The biophysical organization of the resting inner leaflet is poised to respond appropriately to this extracellular stimulation. The resting inner leaflet is generally less ordered than the outer leaflet, with a lipid composition that does not spontaneously phase separate in model membranes. We proposed that coupling between the two leaflets mediates separation into different phase-like domains in the inner leaflet. To test this hypothesis in live cells, we first established a straightforward approach to evaluate changes in membrane order due to inter-leaflet coupling by measuring inner leaflet diffusion of phase-specific lipid probes with Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) before and after methyl--cyclodextrin (mCD)-catalyzed exchange of outer leaflet lipids (LEX) with exogenous order- or disorder-promoting phospholipids. We examined the functional impact of LEX by monitoring two Ag-stimulated cellular responses, namely early-stage recruitment of Syk kinase to the inner leaflet and late-stage exocytosis of secretory granules (degranulation). Based on changes in probe diffusion, we observed global increase or decrease of inner leaflet order when outer leaflet is exchanged with order or disorder promoting lipids, respectively, in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, the degree of stimulated Syk recruitment and degranulation correlates with the inner leaflet order of the resting cells, which was varied using LEX. Overall, combined LEX and ImFCS platform provides strong evidence of lipid-based control of stimulated TM signaling in live mast cells. In addition, our functional results imply that resting-state lipid composition and ordering of the outer leaflet sets the ordering of the inner leaflet, likely via interleaflet coupling, and correspondingly modulates TM signaling initiated by antigen-activated IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECoupling between plasma membrane leaflets, which are biochemically and biophysically asymmetric, results in a steady-state membrane organization that is thought to play fundamental roles in cellular functions. Here, we present a straightforward assay built around mCD-catalyzed lipid exchange (LEX) and Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) to quantitatively characterize a novel, lipid-driven, interleaflet coupling mechanism and its functional impact in live mast cells. We showed that elevation of outer leaflet lipid order induces ordering throughout the inner leaflet in resting cells. This ordering enhances protein-based reactions during Ag-stimulated Fc{varepsilon}RI signaling and consequent cellular response. Overall, we provide a compelling evidence of functional relevance of plasma membrane organizational heterogeneity driven by lipid-based interleaflet coupling."

    "abstract": "Aggregation of neuronal protein -synuclein is implicated in synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease. Despite abundant in vitro studies, the mechanism of -synuclein assembly process remains ambiguous. In this work, -synuclein aggregation was induced by its constant mixing in two separate modes, either by agitation in a 96-well microplate reader (MP) or in microcentrifuge tubes using a shaker incubator (SI). Aggregation in both modes occurred through a sigmoidal growth pattern with a well-defined lag, growth, and saturation phase. The end-stage MP- and SI-derived aggregates displayed distinct differences in morphological, biochemical, and spectral signatures as discerned through AFM, proteinase-K digestion, FTIR, Raman, and CD spectroscopy. The MP-derived aggregates showed irregular morphology with a significant random coil conformation, contrary to SI-derived aggregates, which showed typical {beta}-sheet fibrillar structures. The end-stage MP aggregates convert to {beta}-rich SI-like aggregates upon 1) seeding with SI-derived aggregates and 2) agitating in SI. We conclude that end-stage MP aggregates were in a kinetically trapped conformation, whose kinetic barrier was bypassed upon either seeding by SI-derived fibrils or shaking in SI. We further show that MP-derived aggregates that form in the presence of sorbitol, an osmolyte, displayed a {beta}-rich signature, indicating that the preferential exclusion effect of osmolytes helped overcome the kinetic barrier. Our findings help in unravelling the kinetic origin of different -synuclein aggregated polymorphs (strains) that encode diverse variants of synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that kinetic control shapes the polymorphic landscape of -synuclein aggregates, both through de novo generation of polymorphs, and by their interconversion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517910v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef374forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118250aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27c793org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19f9569_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) provides affordable methods for genotyping hundreds of individuals using millions of markers. However, this challenges bioinformatic procedures that must overcome possible artifacts such as the bias generated by PCR duplicates and sequencing errors. Genotyping errors lead to data that deviate from what is expected from regular meiosis. This, in turn, leads to difficulties in grouping and ordering markers resulting in inflated and incorrect linkage maps. Therefore, genotyping errors can be easily detected by linkage map quality evaluations.\n\nResultsWe developed and used the Reads2Map workflow to build linkage maps with simulated and empirical GBS data of diploid outcrossing populations. The workflows run GATK and freebayes for SNP calling and updog, polyRAD, and SuperMASSA for genotype calling, and OneMap and GUSMap to build linkage maps. Using simulated data, we observed which genotype call software fails in identifying common errors in GBS sequencing data and proposed specific filters to better handle them. We tested whether it is possible to overcome errors in a linkage map using genotype probabilities from each software or global error rates to estimate genetic distances with an updated version of OneMap. We also evaluated the impact of segregation distortion, contaminant samples, and haplotype-based multiallelic markers in the final linkage maps. The results showed a low impact of segregation distortion in the linkage map quality, improvements in ordering markers with haplotype-based multiallelic markers, and improved maps with expected size using reliable genotype probabilities or a global error rate of 5%.\n\nConclusionsThe pipelines results in each scenario changed according to the data set used, indicating that optimal pipelines and parameters are dataset-dependent and cannot be generalized to all GBS data sets. The Reads2Map workflow can reproduce the analysis in other GBS empirical data sets where users can select the pipeline and parameters adapted to their data context. The Reads2MapApp shiny app provides a graphical representation of the results to facilitate their interpretation."

    "abstract": "Engineered proteins have emerged as novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and catalysts. Often, poor protein developability, quantified by expression, solubility, and stability, hinders utility. The ability to predict protein developability from amino acid sequence would reduce the experimental burden when selecting candidates. Recent advances in screening technologies enabled a high-throughput developability dataset for 105 of 1020 possible variants of protein ligand scaffold Gp2. In this work, we evaluate the ability of neural networks to learn a developability representation from a high-throughput dataset and transfer this knowledge to predict recombinant expression beyond observed sequences. The model convolves learned amino acid properties to predict expression levels 44% closer to the experimental variance compared to a non-embedded control. Analysis of learned amino acid embeddings highlights the uniqueness of cysteine, the importance of hydrophobicity and charge, and the unimportance of aromaticity, when aiming to improve the developability of small proteins. We identify clusters of similar sequences with increased developability through nonlinear dimensionality reduction and we explore the inferred developability landscape via nested sampling. The analysis enables the first direct visualization of the fitness landscape and highlights the existence of evolutionary bottlenecks in sequence space giving rise to competing subpopulations of sequences with different developability. The work advances applied protein engineering efforts by predicting and interpreting protein scaffold developability from a limited dataset. Furthermore, our statistical mechanical treatment of the problem advances foundational efforts to characterize the structure of the protein fitness landscape and the amino acid characteristics that influence protein developability."

These hurdles are further heightened for researchers who are not experienced in writing computer code, since the majority of available analysis tools require programming skills. Even for proficient computational biologists, an efficient and replicable system is warranted to generate standardized results.\n\nResultsWe have developed RNAlysis, a modular Python-based analysis software for RNA sequencing data. RNAlysis allows users to build customized analysis pipelines suiting their specific research questions, going all the way from raw FASTQ files, through exploratory data analysis and data visualization, clustering analysis, and gene-set enrichment analysis. RNAlysis provides a friendly graphical user interface, allowing researchers to analyze data without writing code. We demonstrate the use of RNAlysis by analyzing RNA data from different studies using C. elegans nematodes. We note that the software is equally applicable to data obtained from any organism.\n\nConclusionsRNAlysis is suitable for investigating a variety of biological questions, and allows researchers to more accurately and reproducibly run comprehensive bioinformatic analyses. It functions as a gateway into RNA sequencing analysis for less computer-savvy researchers, but can also help experienced bioinformaticians make their analyses more robust and efficient, as it offers diverse tools, scalability, automation, and standardization between analyses."

    "abstract": "Cell classes in the human retina are highly heterogeneous with their abundance varying by several orders of magnitude. Although previous studies reported the profiles of the retinal cell types as the transcriptome level, there is no study regarding the open-chromatin profiles at a similar resolution. Here, we generated and integrated a multi-omics single-cell atlas of the adult human retina, including over 250K nuclei for single-nuclei RNA-seq and 137K nuclei for single-nuclei ATAC-seq. Through enrichment of rare cell types, this single cell multiome atlas is more comprehensive than previous human retina studies. Cross species comparison of the retina atlas among human, monkey, mice, and chicken revealed relatively conserved and non-conserved types. Interestingly, the overall cell heterogeneity in primate retina decreases compared to that of rodent and chicken retina. Furthermore, integrative analysis of the single cell multi-omics data identified 35k distal cis-element-gene pairs with most of these cis-elements being cell type specific. We also showed that the cis-element-gene relationship in different cell types within the same class could be highly heterogenous. Moreover, we constructed transcription factor (TF)-target regulons for over 200 TFs, partitioned the TFs into distinct co-active modules, and annotated each module based on their cell-type specificity. Taken together, we present the most comprehensive single-cell multi-omics atlas of the human retina as a valuable resource that enables systematic in-depth molecular characterization at individual cell type resolution."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for hemophilia using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors allows long-term coagulation factor expression. We examined the potential of a novel engineered liver-tropic AAV3B-based vector AAV.GT5 for hemophilia B gene therapy. In vitro transduction with AAV.GT5 in human hepatocytes was more than 100 times higher than with AAV-Spark100, while in vivo transduction efficacy into the liver and the increase in coagulation factor IX (FIX) antigen following intravenous injection of these vectors were similar in PXB mice (chimeric mice with a humanized liver) and macaques. The discrepancy was due to the low recovery and short half-life of AAV.GT5 in blood, depending on the positive charge of the heparin-binding site in the original AAV3B. The intra-hepatic vascular administration of AAV.GT5, but not AAV-Spark100, enhanced vector transduction into the liver and reduced vector distribution to the kidney in pigs. In macaques, the intra-hepatic artery injection of AAV.GT5 yielded a comparable increase in FIX antigen with a one-third dosage of peripheral venous administration. Two of four macaques who received AAV.GT5 intravenously did not develop neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AAV.GT5, while AAV-Spark100 induced serotype-specific NAbs in all four macaques. The NAb produced after the administration was relatively specific to the serotype and less responsive to the other serotype. As a result, the administration of AAV.GT5 successfully boosted FIX expression in one animal previously given AAV-Spark100. Thus, AAV.GT5 has different biodistribution and immunogenic characteristics compared with AAV-Spark100, and the intra-hepatic vascular administration may lessen the vector dose and avoid vector distribution to other organs.\n\nKey PointsO_LIThe AAV.GT5 vector has a strong transduction efficacy in human hepatocytes but has a faster clearance after systemic administration.\nC_LIO_LIIntra-hepatic vascular administration of the AAV.GT5 vector is an effective liver transduction method for hemophilia gene therapy.\nC_LI"

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is central to force production in numerous cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a dynamic actin meshwork is required to deform the membrane against high membrane tension or turgor pressure. Previous experimental work from our lab showed that several endocytic proteins, including actin and actin-interacting proteins, turn over several times during the formation of a vesicle during CME in yeast and their dwell-time distributions were reminiscent of Gamma distributions with a peak around 1 s (Lacy et al., 2019). However, the distribution for the filament crosslinking protein fimbrin contains a second peak around 0.5 s. To better understand the nature of these dwell-time distributions, here we developed a stochastic model for the dynamics of actin and its binding partners. Our model demonstrates that very fast actin filament disassembly is necessary to reproduce experimental dwell-time distributions. Our model also predicts that actin-binding proteins bind rapidly to nascent filaments and filaments are fully decorated. Last, our model predicts that fimbrin detachment from actin endocytic structures is mechanosensitive to explain the extra peak observed in the dwell-time distribution."

Here, 19 LD-associated proteins were identified in Aspergillus oryzae using colocalization screening of a previously established Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins library. Following a functional screening, 12 candidates have been identified as lipid droplet regulating (LDR) proteins, the loss of which resulted in aberrant LD biogenesis. LDR proteins bind to LD via the insertion of the putative amphipathic helices (AHs) that were investigated using AH-disruptive mutations and subsequent imaging. Further analysis revealed that LdrA with Opi1 domain is essential for cytoplasmic and nuclear LD biogenesis via a novel AH. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the pattern of their evolution, which was predominantly based-on gene duplication.

Here we establish a hepatic regulatory axis for IDE through WDR23-proteostasis. Wdr23KO mice have increased IDE expression, reduced circulating insulin, and defective insulin responses. Genetically engineered human cell models lacking WDR23 also increase IDE expression and display dysregulated phosphorylation of insulin signaling cascade proteins, IRS-1, AKT2, MAPK, and mTOR. Mechanistically, the cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2, a direct target of WDR23-Cul4 proteostasis, mediates the enhanced transcriptional expression of IDE when WDR23 is ablated. Moreover, an analysis of human genetic variation in WDR23 across a large naturally aging human cohort in the US Health and Retirement Study reveals a significant association of WDR23 with altered hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels in older adults that supports the use of WDR23 as new molecular determinant of metabolic health in humans."

    "abstract": "The non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC is overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in various human cancers, and facilitates cancer progression by promoting invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying SRC upregulation are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) induces SRC expression at the transcriptional level by activating a novel intragenic SRC enhancer. In the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A and triple-negative breast cancer cell line BT-549, TGF-{beta}1 stimulation upregulated the SRC1A promoter, resulting in increased SRC mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analysis revealed that SMAD2 binds to three enhancer regions ~15 kb upstream and downstream of the SRC promoter, and one of them is capable of activating the SRC promoter in response to TGF-{beta}. In addition, JUN, which is a member of the activator protein (AP)-1 family, also localizes to the enhancer and regulates TGF-{beta}-induced SRC expression. Moreover, the total amount of active SRC increased, coinciding with the TGF-{beta}-induced SRC expression. In TGF-{beta}-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-{beta}-induced SRC upregulation plays a crucial role in EMT-associated cell migration by activating the SRC/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) circuit. Overall, these results suggest that TGF-{beta}-induced SRC upregulation promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis in a subset of human malignancies."

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes harbor many more enhancers than genes, which greatly complicates the elucidation of cell-state-specific regulatory networks. Here, we developed a computational framework for learning enhancer-based gene networks from joint data on enhancer activity and transcript abundance. Dissecting the developmental plasticity of T helper (Th) cells with this approach, we uncovered a highly connected enhancer-gene network that supports graded Th-cell differentiation states, rather than mutual exclusivity of type-1 and type-2 immunity. Machine learning identifies a small number of regulatory enhancer types as network hubs. Hub enhancers in Th1 cells integrate as inputs the expression level of the master-regulator transcription factor, T-bet, and STAT signals governed by the cytokine environment. The quantitative balance between cell-intrinsic T-bet, driving phenotypic stability, and environmental cues enabling plasticity explains the heterogeneous reprogramming capacities of individual Th1 cells differentiating during natural infections in vivo. Moreover, we provide a framework for elucidating genome-scale regulatory networks based on enhancer activity."

    "abstract": "Enzyme spatial organisation and compartmentalisation are naturally evolved mechanisms for facilitating multi-step biocatalysis. We explored the synthetic in vivo co-encapsulation of two different cargo proteins in yeast using a self-assembling virus-like particle. Co-encapsulation was verified using single particle techniques for both end-to-end fusion of the cargo proteins with the encapsulation anchor at one end, and coexpression of each cargo protein with their individual anchors. The co-encapsulation of a bifunctional geranyl diphosphate/farnesyl diphosphate synthase and a bifunctional linalool/nerolidol synthase delivered nerolidol titres up to 30 times that of an unorganised  free enzyme control, a remarkable improvement from a single engineering step. Interestingly, striking differences in the ratio of products (linalool and nerolidol) were observed with each spatial organisation approach. This work presents the largest reported titre fold increases from in vivo enzyme compartmentalisation and suggests that enzyme spatial organisation could be used to modulate the product profile of promiscuous enzymes."

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of organismic complexity and the genomic basis of gene-regulation is one of the main challenges in the postgenomic era. While thousands of new genomes are available today, no accurate methods exist to reliably mine those for microRNAs, an important class of post-transcriptional regulators. Currently, their prediction and annotation depend on the availability of transcriptomics data sets and hands-on expert knowledge leading to the large discrepancy between novel genomes made available and the availability of high-quality microRNA complements. Using the more than 16,000 microRNA entries from the manually curated microRNA gene database MirGeneDB, we generated and trained covariance models for each conserved microRNA family. These models are available in MirMachine, our new pipeline for automated annotation of conserved microRNAs. We show that MirMachine can be used to accurately and precisely predict conserved microRNA complements from genome assemblies, correctly identifying the number of paralogues, and by establishing the novel microRNA score, the completeness of assemblies. Built and trained on representative metazoan microRNA complements, we used MirMachine on a wide range of animal species, including those with very large genomes or additional genome duplications and extinct species such as mammoths, where deep small RNA sequencing data will be hard to produce. With accurate predictions of conserved microRNAs, the MirMachine workflow closes a long-persisting gap in the microRNA field that will not only facilitate automated genome annotation pipelines and can serve as a solid foundation for manual curation efforts, but deeper studies on the evolution of genome regulation, even in extinct organisms.

Binding and expression target analysis (BETA) integrates the binding and gene expression data to predict this function. First, the regulatory potential of the factor is modeled based on the distance of its binding sites from the transcription start sites in a decay function. Then the differential expression statistics from an experiment where this factor was perturbed represent the binding effect. The rank product of the two values is employed to order in importance. This algorithm was originally implemented in Python. We reimplemented the algorithm in R to take advantage of existing data structures and other tools for downstream analyses. Here, we attempted to replicate the findings in the original BETA paper. We applied the new implementation to the same datasets using default and varying inputs and cutoffs. We successfully replicated the original results. Moreover, we showed that the method was appropriately influenced by varying the input and was robust to choices of cutoffs in statistical testing."

Using simulated data and two scRNA-seq data sets from different tissues, we show that our method improves accuracy over a simple consensus algorithm and the average of the underlying tools. We then compare our method to a non-parametric neighbor majority approach, showing comparable results. We also demonstrate that our GCN method allows for feature interpretation, pulling out important genes for cell type classification.

SCALA is fully parameterizable at every step of the analysis, presenting data in tabular format and produces publication-ready 2D and 3D visualizations including heatmaps, barcharts, scatter, violin and volcano plots. We demonstrate the functionality of SCALA through two use-cases related to TNF-driven arthritic mice, handling data from both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq experiments.

    "abstract": "Mining multimodal pharmaceutical data is crucial for in-silico drug candidate screening and discovery. A daunting challenge of integrating multimodal data is to enable dynamic feature modeling generalizable for real-world applications. Unlike conventional approaches using a simple concatenation with fixed parameters, in this paper, we develop a dynamic interaction learning network to adaptively integrate drug and different reactants on multimodal tasks towards robust drug response prediction. The primary objective of dynamic learning falls into two key aspects: at micro-level, we aim to dynamically search specific relational patterns on the whole reactant range for each drug-reactant pair; at macro-level, drug features can be used to adaptively correlate with different reactants. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach in both drug protein interaction (DPI) and cancer drug response (CDR) tasks. Our approach achieves superior performance on both DPI (AUC = 0.967) and CDR (AUC = 0.932) tasks, outperforming competitive baselines from four real-world, drug-outcome datasets. In addition, the performance on the challenging blind subsets is remarkably improved, where AUC value increases from 0.843 to 0.937 on blind protein set of DPI task, and Pearsons correlation value increases from 0.516 to 0.566 on blind drug set of CDR task. A series of case studies highlight the potential generalization and interpretability of dynamic learning in the in-silico drug response assessment."

PRSs were calculated using a thresholding-pruning-based approach based on 11 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Overall, the odds ratios tended to increase as PRSs were larger, with the odds ratio of the top 5% PRSs being 1.71 (95% confidence interval: 1.31-2.23), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction model being of 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.747-0.774). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the prediction model with and without PRSs as covariates were compared using DeLongs test, and a significant difference was observed. Our results suggest that PRSs can be valuable tools for predicting the risk of lung cancer."

State-of-the-art tools for metagenomic profiling often rely on homology based and marker based identification of marker sequences using complex and compute intensive methods. Such approaches often have difficulties in accurate strain level profiling due to limited read support. Furthermore, incorporation of updates to the reference data are expensive. We develop MAGE, which is a non-homology based, non-marker based and alignment free strain level profiling tool for accurate abundance estimation. MAGE works with a k-mer based index of the reference data. MAGE uses a combination of the well-known FM index and R-index, together with an efficient meta-index for constructing a compact and comprehensive index. Using the read mapping results MAGE performs strain level abundance estimations. In order to obtain accurate estimates, MAGE performs a novel local search based optimization which computes maximum likelihood estimates subject to constraints on read coverage. We performed several experiments for strain level profiling, where MAGE showed superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art on a wide range of performance metrics."

EMG recordings were also used to measure muscle activity.\n\nMain resultsThe MagPen prototype when driven by alternating current, generates time-varying magnetic field which as per Faradays Law of Electromagnetic Induction, induces an electric field for neuromodulation. The orientation dependent spatial contour maps for the induced electric field from the MagPen prototype has been numerically simulated. Furthermore, in this in vivo work on MS, a dose-response relationship has been reported by experimentally studying how the varying amplitude (Range: 25 mVp-p through 6 Vp-p) and frequency (Range: 100 Hz through 5 kHz) of the MagPen stimuli alters the hind limb movement. The primary highlight of this dose-response relationship is that at a higher frequency of the MS stimuli, significantly smaller amplitudes can trigger hind limb muscle twitch. This frequency-dependent activation can be justified following directly from the Faradays Law as the magnitude of the induced electric field is directly proportional to frequency.\n\nSignificanceThis work reports that MS can successfully activate the sciatic nerve in a dose-dependent manner. The MagPen probe, unlike electrodes, does not have a direct electrochemical interface with tissues rendering it much safer than an electrode. Magnetic fields create more precise activation than electrodes because they induce smaller volumes of activation. Finally, unique features of MS such as orientation dependence, directionality and spatial selectivity have been demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Chronic heart disease (CHD) is a common comorbidity of patients receiving endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The ventricular systolic function determines the hemodynamic environments in aorta, and thus regulating the formation of postoperative thrombus. However, the explicit relationship between ventricular systolic function and EVAR complication of thrombotic events is unknown. Here, we proposed a three-dimensional numerical model coupled with the lumped-elements heart model, which is capable of simulating thrombus formation in diverse systolic functions. The computational results show that that thrombus tended to occur at the interior side of the aorta arch and iliac branches, which is consistent with the post-operative imaging follow-up. In addition, we found that both an increase in maximum ventricular contractile force and a decrease in minimum ventricular contractile force inhibit thrombus formation, whereas the effect of heart rate on thrombus formation is not significant. In conclusion, changes in ventricular systolic function may alter the risk of thrombotic events after EVAR repair, which could provide insight into the selection of adjuvant therapy strategies for AAA patients with CHD."

MF are crucial to efficiently implement the modules of large-scale brain models maintaining the specificity of local microcircuits. While MFs have been generated for the isocortex, they are still missing for other parts of the brain. Here we have designed and simulated a multi-layer MF of the cerebellar network (including Granule Cells, Golgi Cells, Molecular Layer Interneurons, and Purkinje Cells) and validated it against experimental data and the corresponding spiking neural network (SNN) microcircuit model. The cerebellar MF was built using a system of equations, where properties of neuronal populations and topological parameters are embedded in inter-dependent transfer functions. The model time constant was optimised using local field potentials recorded experimentally from acute mouse cerebellar slices as a template. The MF satisfactorily reproduced the average dynamics of the different neuronal populations in response to various input patterns and predicted the modulation of Purkinje Cells firing depending on cortical plasticity, which drives learning in associative tasks, and the level of feedforward inhibition. The cerebellar MF provides a computationally efficient tool that will allow to investigate the causal relationship between microscopic neuronal properties and ensemble brain activity in virtual brain models addressing both physiological and pathological conditions."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Recent years have demonstrated the feasibility of using intracortical Brain-Machine Interfaces (iBMIs), by decoding thoughts, for communication and cursor control tasks. iBMIs are increasingly becoming wireless due to the risks of infection and mechanical failure associated with percutaneous connections. However, wireless communication increases the power consumption, and the total power dissipation is strictly limited due to safety heating limits of cortical tissue. Since wireless power is proportional to the communication bandwidth, the output Bit Rate (BR) must be minimised. Whilst most iBMIs utilise Multi-Unit activity (MUA), i.e. spike events, and this in itself significantly reduces the output BR (compared to raw data), it still limits the scalability (number of channels) that can be achieved. As such, additional compression for MUA signals is essential for fully-implantable, high-information-bandwidth systems. To meet this need, this work proposes various hardware-efficient, ultra-low power MUA compression schemes. They are investigated in terms of their BRs and hardware requirements as a function of various on-implant conditions such as MUA Binning Period (BP) and number of channels. It was found that for BPs [&le;]10 ms, the Delta Event-Driven method had the lowest total dynamic power and reduced the BR by almost an order of magnitude relative to classical methods (e.g. to approx. 151 bps/channel for a BP of 1 ms and 1000 channels on-implant.). However, at larger BPs the Windowing method performed best (e.g. approx. 29 bps/channel for a BP of 50 ms, independent of channel count). As such, this work can guide the choice of MUA data compression scheme for BMI applications, where the BR can be significantly reduced in hardware efficient ways. This enables the next generation of wireless iBMIs, with small implant sizes, high channel counts, low-power, and small hardware footprint. All code and results have been made publicly available."

    "date": "2022-11-25",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Vinculin is a protein associated to linking adhesion receptors facing the outside of cells and reinforcing them by linking its intracellular domain of those receptors or, in the case of Cell-Matrix adhesions, to bind to a first level adaptor protein such as talin. The structural organization of vinculin allows it to bind on one part to specific amphipathic motifs collectively designated as vinculin binding sites (VBS), to a set of different vinculin coactivators or actin regulators, and finally a domain responsible to constantly bind to F-actin in a catch bond manner. However, the ability of vinculin to effectively bind all of those intracellular partners, is highly dependent on its structural organization. Which is critically dependent on its ability to respond to mechanical tension on the molecule itself and not necessarily to its binding capacity to VBSs and complementary activators. This is recognized as the combinatorial model of activation. Nonetheless, Shigellas IpaA effector protein is able to mimic the conformational changes associated with the ones associated with the mechanical deformation of the molecule. This model of vinculin activation is designated as the non-combinatorial model, as the presence of a single activation-partner is enough to get the same effect. This work is devoted to dig in further to develop the previous work from this lab, as we have been able to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects of Shigellas IpaA-Cterm region as the one responsible for both inducing conformational changes in solution, as well as the formation of super-stable adhesion, associated to maturity markers as VASP and alpha actinin. Additionally the IpaA-Cterm transfection renders those cells with the ability to maintain the adhesion structures stable and even resist the action of actomyosin relaxing molecules. Which renders them as mechanically-independent adhesions. We found that residue substitution at the surface of D1 and D2 interphase, (as well as residues maintaining the D2 domain helical bundles folded), might participate in the maintaining the structural integrity and interdomain interaction during force dependent as revealed by its ability to form protein complexes in vitro and under force-independent settings, as the morphology of cellular adhesions is altered in a way different from the previously reported targeting only the D1-D5 interaction."

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying these loci remains a challenge because the causal variants and the tissues in which they act are often unclear. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have the potential to link differences in genome sequence, including genetic variants, to tissue-specific regulatory function. Although MPRA and similar technologies have been widely adopted in cell culture, there have been several barriers to widespread use in animals. We overcome these challenges with a new whole-animal MPRA (WhAMPRA), where systemic intravenous AAV effectively transduces the plasmid MPRA library to mouse tissues. Our WhAMPRA approach revealed models of tissue-specific regulation that generally match machine learning model predictions. In addition, we measured the regulatory effects of disrupting MEF2C transcription factor binding sites and impacts of late onset Alzheimers disease-associated genetic variations. Overall, our WhAMPRA technology simultaneously determines the transcriptional functions of hundreds of enhancers in vivo across multiple tissues."

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) genome organization influences diverse nuclear processes. Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and Hi-C are powerful methods to study the 3D genome organization. However, ChIA-PET and Hi-C experiments are expensive, time-consuming, require tens to hundreds of millions of cells, and are challenging to optimize and analyze. Predicting ChIA-PET/Hi-C data using cheaper ChIP-Seq data and other easily obtainable features could be a useful alternative. It is well-established that the cohesin protein complex is a key determinant of 3D genome organization. Here we present Chromatin Interaction Predictor (ChIPr), a suite of regression models based on deep neural networks (DNN), random forest, and gradient boosting, respectively, to predict cohesin-mediated chromatin interaction strength between any two loci in the genome. Comprehensive tests on four cell lines show that the predictions of ChIPr correlate well with the original ChIA-PET data at the peak-level resolution and bin sizes of 25 and 5 Kbp. In addition, ChIPr can accurately capture most of the cell-type-dependent loops identified by ChIA-PET and Hi-C data. Rigorous feature testing indicated that genomic distance and RAD21 (a cohesin component) ChIP-Seq signals are the most important inputs for ChIPr in determining chromatin interaction strength. The standard ChIPr model requires three experimental inputs: ChIP-Seq signals for RAD21, H3K27ac (enhancer/active chromatin mark) and H3K27me3 (inactive chromatin mark). The minimal ChIPr model performs comparably and requires a single experimental input: ChIP-Seq signals for RAD21. Integrative analysis revealed novel insights into the role of CTCF motif, its orientation, and CTCF binding on the prevalence and strength of cohesin-mediated chromatin interactions. These studies outline the general features of genome folding and open new avenues to analyze spatial genome organization in specimens with limited cell numbers."

    "date": "2022-11-25",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Background and PurposeDecreased aortic compliance is a precursor to numerous cardiovascular diseases. Compliance is regulated by the stiffness of the aortic wall and the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within it. During ageing, the extracellular matrix of the aortic wall stiffens, reducing compliance and leading to conditions such as hypertension. In response, VSMCs generate enhanced contractile forces and undergo hypertrophy, promoting VSMC stiffening and further reducing compliance. Due to a lack of suitable in vitro models, the mechanisms driving VSMC hypertrophy in response to matrix stiffness remain poorly defined.\n\nExperimental ApproachHuman VSMCs were seeded onto polyacrylamide hydrogels whose stiffness mimicked either healthy or aged/diseased aortae. VSMC response to contractile agonist stimulation was measured through changes in cell area and volume. VSMCs were pre-treated with pharmacological agents prior to agonist stimulation to identify regulators of VSMC contractility and hypertrophy.\n\nKey ResultsVSMCs undergo a differential response to contractile agonist stimulation based on matrix stiffness. On pliable hydrogels, VSMCs contract, decreasing in cell area whereas on rigid hydrogels, VSMCs undergo a hypertrophic response, increasing in area and volume. Microtubule stabilisation prevented hypertrophy whilst leaving VSMC contraction on pliable hydrogels unimpeded. Conversely, microtubule destabilisation inhibited contraction and induced hypertrophy within VSMCs on pliable hydrogels.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsIn response to enhanced matrix rigidity, VSMC undergo a hypertrophic response as result of decreased microtubule stability. Using standard biological techniques and equipment, we present a screening assay capable of identifying novel regulators of matrix rigidity induced VSMC hypertrophy. This assay can identify both beneficial and deleterious effects of pharmacological agents to cardiovascular health.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517637v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a2062org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4433bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a078b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5439d6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract. Microtubule stability regulates VSMC response to contractile agonist stimulation.\n\nFollowing contractile agonist stimulation, isolated VSMCs seeded on pliable substrates undergo a contractile response, decreasing in cell area whilst maintaining a consistent volume. VSMCs seeded on rigid substrates fail to undergo a contractile response following contractile agonist stimulation and instead undergo a hypertrophic response, increasing in area and volume. VSMC hypertrophy can be prevented on rigid substrates through microtubule stabilisation.

    "abstract": "Generating the hash values of short subsequences, called seeds, enables quickly identifying similarities between genomic sequences by matching seeds with a single lookup of their hash values. However, these hash values can be used only for finding exact-matching seeds as the conventional hashing methods assign distinct hash values for different seeds, including highly similar seeds. Finding only exact-matching seeds causes either 1) increasing the use of the costly sequence alignment or 2) limited sensitivity.\n\nWe introduce BLEND, the first efficient and accurate mechanism that can identify both exact-matching and highly similar seeds with a single lookup of their hash values, called fuzzy seed matches. BLEND 1) utilizes a technique called SimHash, that can generate the same hash value for similar sets, and 2) provides the proper mechanisms for using seeds as sets with the SimHash technique to find fuzzy seed matches efficiently.\n\nWe show the benefits of BLEND when used in read overlapping and read mapping. For read overlapping, BLEND is faster by 2.4x-83.9x (on average 19.3x), has a lower memory footprint by 0.9x-14.1 x (on average 3.8x), and finds higher quality overlaps leading to accurate de novo assemblies than the state-of-the-art tool, minimap2.

This motivates a method to leverage information from previously generated large scale scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq data to guide our analysis of new scATAC-seq datasets. We analyze scATAC-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a Bayesian algorithm that was developed to model text corpora, summarizing documents as mixtures of topics defined based on the words that distinguish the documents. When applied to scATAC-seq, LDA treats cells as documents and their accessible sites as words, identifying \"topics\" based on the cell type-specific accessible sites in those cells. Previous work used uniform symmetric priors in LDA, but we hypothesized that nonuniform matrix priors generated from LDA models trained on existing data sets may enable improved detection of cell types in new data sets, especially if they have relatively few cells. In this work, we test this hypothesis in scATAC-seq data from whole C. elegans nematodes and SHARE-seq data from mouse skin cells. We show that nonsymmetric matrix priors for LDA improve our ability to capture cell type information from small scATAC-seq datasets."

    "abstract": "The identification of genes that vary across spatial domains in tissues and cells is an essential step for spatial transcriptomics data analysis. Given the critical role it serves for downstream data interpretations, various methods for detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) have been proposed. The availability of multiple methods for detecting SVGs bears questions such as whether different methods select a similar set of SVGs, how reliable is the reported statistics significance from each method, how accurate and robust is each method in terms of SVG detection, and how well the selected SVGs perform in downstream applications such as clustering of spatial domains. Besides these, practical considerations such as computational time and memory usage are also crucial for deciding which method to use. In this study, we address the above questions by systematically evaluating a panel of popular SVG detection methods on a large collection of spatial transcriptomics datasets, covering various tissue types, biotechnologies, and spatial resolutions. Our results shed light on the performance of each method from multiple aspects and highlight the discrepancy among different methods especially on calling statistically significant SVGs across datasets. Taken together, our work provides useful considerations for choosing methods for identifying SVGs and serves as a key reference for the future development of such methods."

Using ExposomeX, we can effectively analyze the multiple-dimensional exposomics data and investigate the \"Exposure-Biology-Disease\" nexus by exploring mediation and interaction effects, understanding statistical and biological mechanisms, strengthening prediction performance, and automatically conducting meta-analysis based on well-established literature databases. The performance of ExposomeX has been well validated by re-analyzing two previous multi-omics studies. Additionally, ExposomeX can efficiently help discover new associations, as well as relevant in-depth biological pathways via protein-protein interaction and gene ontology network analysis.

    "abstract": "Cryptic pockets, or pockets absent in ligand-free, experimentally determined structures, hold great potential as drug targets. However, cryptic pocket opening is often beyond the reach of conventional biomolecular simulations because certain cryptic pocket openings involve slow motions. Here, we investigate whether AlphaFold can be used to accelerate cryptic pocket discovery either by generating structures with open pockets directly or generating structures with partially open pockets that can be used as starting points for simulations. We use AlphaFold to generate ensembles for 10 known cryptic pocket examples, including 5 that were deposited after AlphaFolds training data was extracted from the PDB. We find that in 6 out of 10 cases AlphaFold samples the open state. For plasmepsin II, an aspartic protease from the causative agent of malaria, AlphaFold only captures partial pocket opening. As a result, we ran simulations from an ensemble of AlphaFold-generated structures and show that this strategy samples cryptic pocket opening, even though an equivalent amount of simulations launched from a ligand-free experimental structure fails to do so. Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from the AlphaFold-seeded simulations quickly yield a free energy landscape of cryptic pocket opening that is in good agreement with the same landscape generated with well-tempered metadynamics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AlphaFold has a useful role to play in cryptic pocket discovery but that many cryptic pockets may remain difficult to sample using AlphaFold alone."

    "abstract": "Several important human infectious diseases are caused by microscale-sized parasitic nematodes like filarial worms. Filarial worms have their own spatial tissue organization and to uncover this tissue structure, we need methods that can spatially resolve these miniature specimens. Most filarial worms evolved a mutualistic association with endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia, however, the mechanisms underlying the dependency of filarial worms on the fitness of these bacteria remain unknown. As Wolbachia is essential for the development, reproduction, and survival of filarial worms, we focused on studying a posterior region containing reproductive tissue and developing embryos of adult female Brugia malayi worms. To spatially explore how Wolbachia interacts with the worms reproductive system, we performed a spatial characterization using Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) across our region of interest. We provide a proof-of-concept for miniature-ST to explore spatial gene expression patterns in small sample types, demonstrating the methods ability to uncover nuanced tissue region expression patterns, observe the spatial localization of key B. malayi - Wolbachia pathway genes, and co-localize the B. malayi spatial transcriptome in Wolbachia tissue regions. We envision our approach to open up new scenarios for the study of infectious diseases caused by micro-scale parasitic worms."

TWAS uses multi-variant models trained using individual-level genotype-expression datasets, but methodological development is required for TWAS to utilise larger eQTL summary statistics.\n\nMethodsTWAS models predicting gene expression were derived using blood-based eQTL summary statistics from eQTLGen, the Young Finns Study (YFS), and MetaBrain. Summary statistic polygenic scoring methods were used to derive TWAS models, evaluating their predictive utility in GTEx v8. We investigated gene inclusion criteria and omnibus tests for aggregating TWAS associations for a given gene. We performed a schizophrenia TWAS using summary statistic-based TWAS models, comparing results to existing resources and methods.\n\nResultsTWAS models derived using eQTL summary statistics performed comparably to models derived using individual-level data. Multi-variant TWAS models significantly improved prediction over single variant models for 8.6% of genes. TWAS models derived using eQTLGen summary statistics significantly improved prediction over models derived using a smaller individual-level dataset. The eQTLGen-based schizophrenia TWAS, using the ACAT omnibus test to aggregate associations for each gene, identified novel significant and colocalised associations compared to summary-based mendelian randomisation (SMR) and SMR-multi.\n\nConclusionsUsing multi-variant TWAS models and larger eQTL summary statistic datasets can improve power to detect differential expression associations. We provide TWAS models based on eQTLGen and MetaBrain summary statistics, and software to easily derive and apply summary statistic-based TWAS models based on eQTL and other molecular QTL datasets released in the future."

    "abstract": "The negative genetic impacts of gene flow from domestic to wild populations can be dependent on the degree of domestication and exacerbated by the magnitude of pre-existing genetic differences between wild populations and the domestication source. Recent evidence of European ancestry within North American aquaculture Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has elevated the potential impact of escaped farmed salmon on often at-risk wild North American salmon populations. Here we compare the ability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and microsatellite (SSR) marker panels of different sizes (7-SSR, 100-SSR, and 220K-SNP) to detect introgression of European genetic information into North American wild and aquaculture populations. Linear regression comparing admixture predictions for a set of individuals common to the three data sets showed that the 100-SSR panel and 7-SSR panels replicated the full 220K-SNP-based admixture estimates with low accuracy (r2 of 0.64 and 0.49 respectively). Additional tests explored the effects of individual sample size and marker number, which revealed that ~300 randomly selected SNPs could replicate the 220K-SNP admixture predictions with greater than 95% fidelity. We designed a custom SNP panel (301-SNP) for European admixture detection in future monitoring work and then developed and tested a Python package, SalmonEuAdmix (https://github.com/CNuge/SalmonEuAdmix), that uses a deep neural network to make de novo estimates of individuals European admixture proportion without the need to conduct complete admixture analysis utilizing baseline samples. The results demonstrate the mobilization of targeted SNP panels and machine learning in support of at-risk species conservation and management."

    "abstract": "As an essential physiological process, gene expression determines the function of each cell. However, owing to the complex nondeterministic and nonlinear nature of gene expression, the steady-state intracellular protein abundance of a clonal population forms a distribution. The characteristics of this distribution, including expression strength and noise, are closely related to cellular behavior. Therefore, quantitative description of these characteristics is an important goal in biology. This task, however, has so far relied on arrayed methods, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a deep-learning-assisted Sort-Seq approach (dSort-Seq) in this work, enabling high-throughput profiling of expression properties with high precision. We demonstrated the validity of dSort-Seq for large-scale assaying of the dose-response relationships of biosensors. In addition, we comprehensively investigated the contribution of transcription and translation to noise production in E. coli, from which we discovered that the expression noise is strongly coupled with the mean expression level instead of translation strength, even in the case of weak transcription. We also discovered that the transcriptional interference caused by overlapping RpoD-binding sites contributes to noise production, which suggested the existence of a simple and feasible noise control strategy in E. coli. Overall, dSort-Seq is able to efficiently determine the strength-noise landscape, which has promising applications in studies related to gene expression."

In addition, the system is characterized by largely unbiased thermal fluctuations as opposed to standard bilayer systems. Application of the bicelle system for an asymmetric lipid composition resembling the plasma membrane reveals that the cholesterol density for a tension-free plasma membrane with a vanishing spontaneous curvature is larger by 28% within the extracellular leaflet compared to the cytosolic leaflet.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517649v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b06c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c9d6b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e12dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d9093c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Heat shock protein (hsp) encoding genes, part of the highly conserved Heat Shock Response (HSR), are known to be induced by thermal stress in several organisms. In Neurospora crassa, three hsp genes, hsp30, hsp70, and hsp80, have been characterized; however, the role of defined cis-elements in their response to discrete changes in temperature remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, while also aiming to obtain a reliable fungal heat-shock inducible system, we analyzed different sections of each hsp promoter, by assessing the expression of real-time transcriptional reporters. Whereas all three promoters, and their resected versions, were acutely induced by high temperatures, only hsp30 displayed a broad range of expression and high tunability amply exciding other inducible promoter systems existing in Neurospora, such as Quinic acid- or light-inducible ones. As proof of concept, we employed one of these promoters to control the expression of clr-2, which encodes for the master regulator of Neurospora cellulolytic capabilities. The resulting strain fails to grow on cellulose at 25{degrees}C, whereas it robustly grows if heat shock pulses are delivered daily. Additionally, we designed two hsp30 synthetic promoters and characterized these, as well as the native promoters, to a gradient of high temperatures, yielding a wide range of responses to thermal stimuli. Thus, Neurospora hsp30-based promoters represent a new set of modular elements that can be used as a transcriptional rheostat to adjust the expression of a gene of interest or for the implementation of regulated circuitries for synthetic biology and biotechnological strategies.\n\nImportanceTimely and dynamic response to strong temperature rises is paramount for organismal biology. At the same time, inducible promoters are a powerful tool for fungal biotechnological and synthetic biology endeavors. In this work, we analyzed the activity of several N. crassa heat shock protein (hsp) promoters upon a wide range of temperatures, observing that hsp30 exhibits remarkable sensitivity and dynamic range of expression as we chartered the response of this promoter to subtle increases in temperature, while also building synthetic promoters based on hsp30 cis-elements. As proof of concept, we analyzed the ability of hsp30 to provide tight control of a central process such as cellulose degradation. While this study provides an unprecedented description of the regulation of the N. crassa hsp genes it also contributes with a noteworthy addition to the molecular toolset of transcriptional controllers in filamentous fungi."

We generated designer EVs to modulate autoreactive T cells in the context of type 1 diabetes by engineering K562 cells to express HLA-A*02 (HLA-A2) alongside co-stimulatory CD80 and/or co-inhibitory PD-L1. EVs presenting HLA-A2 and CD80 activated CD8+ T cells in a dose, antigen, and HLA-specific manner. Adding PD-L1 to these EVs produced an immunoregulatory response, reducing CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity in vitro. EVs alone could not stimulate T cells without antigen presenting cells (APCs), suggesting that EVs act by cross-dressing APCs. EVs lacking CD80 were ineffective at modulating CD8+ T cell activation, suggesting that both peptide-HLA complex and costimulatory molecules are required for EV-mediated immune modulation through APC cross-dressing. These results provide mechanistic insight into the rational design of EVs as a cell-free, yet precision medicine-based approach to immunotherapy that can be tailored to promote antigen-specific immune tolerance or pro-inflammatory responses."

Single-cell spatial genomic assays were developed recently for this purpose but they remain costly and labor-intensive for examining brain tissues across substantial dimensions and surveying a collection of brain samples. Here we demonstrate a new approach, brain epigenomic tomography, that maps spatial epigenomic variations at the scale of centimeters. We profiled neuronal and glial fractions of mouse neocortex slices with 0.5 mm thickness using a low-input technology. H3K27me3 or H3K27ac features across these slices were grouped into clusters based on their spatial variation patterns. Our approach reveals striking dynamics in frontal and caudal cortex due to kainic acid-induced seizure, linked with transmembrane ion transporter, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and secretion of neurotransmitter. Epigenomic tomography provides a powerful and cost-effective tool for profiling and discerning brain samples based on their spatial epigenomes."

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) maintain translational fidelity through accurate charging by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and codon:anticodon base pairing with the mRNA at the ribosome. Mistranslation occurs when an amino acid not specified by the genetic code is incorporated into a protein. Since alanyl-tRNA synthetase uniquely recognizes a G3:U70 base pair in tRNAAla and the anticodon plays no role in charging, tRNAAla variants with anticodon mutations have the potential to mis-incorporate alanine. Our goal was to characterize the phenotypic consequences of expressing all 60 tRNAAla anticodon variants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overall, 36 tRNAAla anticodon variants decreased growth in single- or multi-copy. Using mass spectrometry, we observed mistranslation for 45 of 55 variants when on single-copy plasmids. There was a weak but statistically significant correlation between mistranslation and reduced growth. Variants with G/C rich anticodons tend to have larger growth deficits and mistranslate at greater frequencies than A/U rich variants. In most instances, synonymous anticodon variants impact growth differently. We suggest that this is explained by decoding specificity, which results in different tRNAAla variants mistranslating unique sets of peptides and proteins. Since potential mistranslating tRNAs exist in humans, our analysis identifies features of tRNAAla variants that influence their potential contribution to disease."

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology holds immense promise to tackle key problems we are facing, for instance in resource use, environmental health, and human health care. However, comprehensive safety measures are needed to deploy genetically engineered microorganisms in open-environment applications. Here, we describe a genetic biocontainment system based on conditional stability of essential proteins. We used a yeast-adapted destabilizing domain degron, which can be stabilized by estradiol addition (ERdd). Leveraging the yeast GFP collection and lab automation platforms, we ERdd-tagged 775 essential genes and screened for strains with estradiol dependent growth. Three genes, SPC110, DIS3 and RRP46, were found to be particularly suitable. Respective strains showed no growth defect in the presence of estradiol and strong growth inhibition in its absence. Of these, SPC110-ERdd offered the most stringent containment, with an escape frequency of 7.0x10-8, and full growth restoration at 100 nM estradiol. By systematically analysing the containment escapees, we identified the non-essential C-terminal region of SPC110 as target for escape mutations. Its removal decreased the escape frequency with a single ERdd tag further to 4.3x10-9. Combining SPC110-ERdd with a second ERdd tag on either DIS3 or RRP46 resulted in escape frequencies below the detection limit of the used assay (<2x10-10). Being based on conditional protein stability, this approach is mechanistically orthogonal to previously reported intrinsic biocontainment systems. It thus can be readily combined with other systems, for instance ones based on transcriptional or translational control of essential gene expression, to achieve multiplexed, extremely stringent control over the survival of engineered organisms."

    "abstract": "Quantum refinement (Q|R) of crystallographic or cryo-EM derived structures of biomolecules within the Q|R project aims at using ab initio computations instead of library-based chemical restraints. An atomic model refinement requires the calculation of the gradient of the objective function. While it is not a computational bottleneck in classic refinement it is a roadblock if the objective function requires ab initio calculations. A solution to this problem adopted in Q|R is to divide the molecular system into manageable parts and do computations for these parts rather than using the whole macromolecule. This work focuses on the validation and optimization of the automatic divide-and-conquer procedure developed within the Q|R project. Also, we propose an atomic gradient error score that can be easily examined with common molecular visualization programs. While the tool is designed to work within the Q|R setting the error score can be adapted to similar fragmentation methods. The gradient testing tool presented here allows a priori determination of the computationally efficient strategy given available resources for the potentially time-expensive refinement process. The procedure is illustrated using a peptide and small protein models considering different quantum mechanical (QM) methodologies from Hartree-Fock, including basis set and dispersion corrections, to the modern semi-empirical method from the GFN-xTB family. The results obtained provide some general recommendations for the reliable and effective quantum refinement of larger peptides and proteins."

Here, we show that oxidative stress triggered by H2O2 exposure induced efficient VE-cadherin proteolysis by MMPs and {gamma}-secretase in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin produced by {gamma}-secretase, VE-Cad/CTF2 - a fragment that has eluded identification so far - could readily be detected after H2O2 treatment. VE-Cad/CTF2, released into the cytosol, was tightly regulated by proteasomal degradation and was sequentially produced from an ADAM10/17-generated C-terminal fragment, VE-Cad/CTF1. Interestingly, BMP9 and BMP10, two circulating ligands critically involved in vascular maintenance, significantly reduced VE-Cad/CTF2 levels during H2O2 challenge, as well as mitigated H2O2-mediated actin cytoskeleton disassembly during VE-cadherin processing. Notably, BMP9/10 pretreatments efficiently reduced apoptosis induced by H2O2, favoring endothelial cell recovery. Thus, oxidative stress is a trigger of MMP- and {gamma}-secretase-mediated endoproteolysis of VE-cadherin and AJ disassembly from the cytoskeleton in ECs, a mechanism that is negatively controlled by the EC quiescence factors, BMP9 and BMP10."

    "abstract": "The evolution of specialized cell-types is a long-standing interest of biologists, but given the deep time-scales very difficult to reconstruct or observe. microRNAs have been linked to the evolution of cellular complexity and may inform on specialization. The endothelium is a vertebrate specific specialization of the circulatory system that enabled a critical new level of vasoregulation. The evolutionary origin of these endothelial cells is unclear. We hypothesized that Mir-126, an endothelial cell-specific microRNA may be informative.\n\nWe here reconstruct the evolutionary history of Mir-126. Mir-126 likely appeared in the last common ancestor of vertebrates and tunicates, a species without an endothelium, within an intron of the evolutionary much older EGF Like Domain Multiple (Egfl) locus. Mir-126 has a complex evolutionary history due to duplications and losses of both the host gene and the microRNA. Taking advantage of the strong evolutionary conservation of the microRNA among Olfactores, and using RNA in situ hybridization (RISH), we localized Mir-126 in the tunicate Ciona robusta. We found exclusive expression of the mature Mir-126 in granular amebocytes, supporting a long-proposed scenario that endothelial cells arose from hemoblasts, a type of proto-endothelial amoebocyte found throughout invertebrates.\n\nThis observed change of expression of Mir-126 from proto-endothelial amoebocytes in the tunicate to endothelial cells in vertebrates is the first direct observation of the evolution of a cell-type in relation to microRNA expression indicating that microRNAs can be a prerequisite of cell-type evolution.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LIdirect observation of cell-type evolution\nC_LIO_LIhigh conservation of sequence enables for simple RISH experiment of expression\nC_LIO_LIMir-126 follows the evolution of hematopoetic cells to endothelial cells\nC_LI"

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "During starvation and stress, virtually all organisms arrest their protein synthesis and convert their ribosomes into a state of dormancy in which a special class of proteins, known as hibernation factors, protect the ribosome from damage. In bacteria, two major families of hibernation factors have been characterized, but the low conservation of these proteins and the huge diversity of species, habitats and environmental stressors has made the discovery of new dormancy factors challenging. In this study, we identify a new bacterial protein involved in ribosome dormancy. We first characterize dormant ribosomes following cold shock in the psychrophilic bacterium Psychrobacter urativorans using proteomics and cryo-EM. We show that during cold shock, ribosomes in this organism associate with a previously uncharacterized protein that occupies ribosomal active centres and multiple drug-binding sites. Our structure reveals that this new factor, which we term Balon, bears no resemblance to known bacterial hibernation factors. Instead, it belongs to a family of bacterial homologs of the eukaryotic translation factor aeRF1. We identify unique motifs present only in Balon but not its archaeal or eukaryotic counterparts that allow it to engage with the peptidyl transferase center and decoding center of dormant bacterial ribosomes. We then show that, across the bacterial kingdom, Balon-encoding genes are found in nearly 20% of known species and are located in operons involved in different types of stress responses, including osmotic and thermal shock, hypoxia, acid, tRNA damage and antibiotic stress. Taken together, our work shows that bacterial cells possess a functional homolog of eukaryotic translation termination factor, which is likely repurposed into a stress-response protein. This finding illuminates a long-sought evolutionary connection between the bacterial and eukaryotic protein synthesis machinery."

    "abstract": "We analyse a multiphase, moving boundary model that describes solid tumour growth. We consider the evolution of a motile, viscous cell phase and an inviscid extracellular liquid phase. The model comprises two partial differential equations that govern the cell volume fraction and the cell velocity, together with a moving boundary condition for the tumour edge. Numerical simulations of the model indicate that patterned solutions can be obtained, which correspond to multiple regions of high cell density separated by regions of low cell density. In other parameter regimes, solutions of the model can develop into a forward- or backward-moving travelling wave, corresponding to tumour growth or extinction, respectively. A travelling-wave analysis allows us to find the corresponding wave speed, as well as criteria for the growth or extinction of the tumour. Furthermore, a stability analysis of these travelling-wave solutions provides us with criteria for the occurrence of patterned solutions. Finally, we discuss how the initial cell distribution, as well as parameters related to cellular motion and cell-liquid drag, control the qualitative features of patterned solutions."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease and highly lethal if untreated. The progressive dilatation of the abdominal aorta is accompanied by degradation and remodeling of the vessel wall due to chronic inflammation. Pannexins represent anion-selective channels and play a crucial role in non-vesicular ATP release to amplify paracrine signaling in cells. Thus, pannexins are involved in many (patho-) physiological processes. Recently, Panx1 channels were identified to be significantly involved in AAA formation through endothelial derived Panx1 regulated inflammation and aortic remodeling. In platelets, Panx1 becomes activated following activation of glycoprotein (GP)VI. Since platelets play a role in cardiovascular diseases including AAA, we analyzed the contribution of platelet Panx1 in the progression of AAA. We detected enhanced Panx1 plasma levels in AAA patients. In experimental AAA using the pancreatic porcine elastase (PPE) mouse model, a major contribution of platelet Panx1 channels in platelet activation, pro-coagulant activity of platelets and platelet-mediated inflammation has been detected. In detail, platelets are important for the migration of neutrophils into the aortic wall induced by direct cell interaction and by activation of endothelial cells. Decreased platelet activation and inflammation did not affect ECM remodeling or wall thickness in platelet-specific Panx1 knock-out mice following PPE surgery. Thus, aortic diameter expansion at different time points after elastase infusion of the aortic wall was unaltered in platelet-specific Panx1 deficient mice suggesting that the modulation of inflammation alone does not affect AAA formation and progression. In conclusion, our data strongly supports the role of platelets in inflammatory responses in AAA via Panx1 channels and adds important knowledge about the significance of platelets in AAA pathology important for the establishment of an anti-platelet therapy for AAA patients."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "BackgroundReceptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) dependent cell death has been identified as a crucial mediator of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. RIPK3 mediates phosphorylation of Mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) thereby inducing its oligomerization and translocation to the cell membrane. Given the dual role of RIPKs being involved in necroptosis as well as in apoptosis induction, the specific role of MLKL-induced necroptotic cell death in AAA remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe monitored elastase-perfusion (PPE) induced progression of AAA in C57BL/6N (WT), RIPK1 kinase-inactive (Ripk1D138N/D138N), MLKL knockout (Mlkl-/-) and MLKL phospho-deficient (MlklAA) mice by ultrasound measurements, histological analyses and bulk mRNA sequencing to assess structural and molecular aortic changes. Bone marrow transplantations in WT and MlklAA mice were utilized to dissect the role of MLKL in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and myeloid cells in AAA development. MLKL expressing human SMCs were generated to investigate necroptosis-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and subsequent polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) migration and activation in vitro.\n\nResultsUltrasound analysis showed that ~70% of the WT animals developed PPE induced-AAA with significant aortic structural alterations and enhanced myeloid cell infiltration. In contrast, Ripk1D138N/D138N, MlklAA, and Mlkl-/- mice were protected from AAA. This protection was associated with reduced adverse extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and leukocyte infiltration. MLKL deficiency was associated with a significant downregulation of genes involved in fibrinolysis, anti-inflammatory response, immune response and complement activation in aortic tissue in AAA. Bone marrow transplantation studies showed the lack of MLKL in SMCs to be the main driver of AAA protection. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion was elevated in necroptosis induced SMCs and resulted in a significant accumulation and activation of PMN.\n\nConclusionsOverall, these findings indicate that MLKL-induced necroptotic SMC death and subsequent proinflammatory leukocyte activation play a causative role in AAA development and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of MLKL may represent a promising treatment strategy for AAA disease."

    "abstract": "During oxidative stress neurons release lipids that are internalized by glia. Defects in this coordinated process play an important role in several neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the mechanisms of lipid release and its consequences on neuronal health are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lipid-protein particle release by autolysosome exocytosis protects neurons from ferroptosis, a form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. We show that during oxidative stress, peroxidated lipids and iron are released from neurons by autolysosomal exocytosis which requires the exocytic machinery; VAMP7 and syntaxin 4. We observe membrane-bound lipid-protein particles by TEM and demonstrate that these particles are released from neurons using cryoEM. Failure to release these lipid-protein particles causes lipid hydroperoxide and iron accumulation and sensitizes neurons to ferroptosis. Our results reveal how neurons protect themselves from peroxidated lipids. Given the number of brain pathologies that involve ferroptosis, defects in this pathway likely play a key role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease.\n\nSUMMARYRelease of lipid-protein particles by autolysosomal exocytosis protects neurons from ferroptosis."

FA is caused by a depletion of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN), an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis factor. To better understand the cellular consequences of FA, we performed quantitative proteome profiling of human cells depleted for FXN. Nearly every known Fe-S cluster-containing protein was depleted in the absence of FXN, indicating that as a rule, cluster binding confers stability to Fe-S proteins. Proteomic and genetic interaction mapping identified impaired mitochondrial translation downstream of FXN loss, and specifically highlighted the methyltransferase-like protein METTL17 as a candidate effector. Using comparative sequence analysis, mutagenesis, biochemistry and cryogenic electron microscopy we show that METTL17 binds to the mitoribosomal small subunit during late assembly and harbors a previously unrecognized [Fe4S4]2+ cluster required for its stability on the mitoribosome. Notably, METTL17 overexpression rescued the mitochondrial translation and bioenergetic defects, but not the cellular growth, of FXN null cells. Our data suggest that METTL17 serves as an Fe-S cluster checkpoint: promoting the translation and assembly of Fe-S cluster rich OXPHOS proteins only when Fe-S cluster levels are replete."

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation increases during aging and is a pathological hallmark of many age-related diseases. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) depends on a core network of factors directly influencing protein production, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Cellular proteostasis also depends on the overall composition of the proteome and numerous environmental variables. Modulating this cellular proteostasis state can influence the stability of multiple endogenous proteins, yet the factors contributing to this state remain incompletely characterized. Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPRi screens to elucidate the modulators of proteostasis state in mammalian cells using a fluorescent dye to monitor endogenous protein aggregation. These screens recovered components of the known proteostasis network, and uncovered a link between protein and lipid homeostasis. We subsequently showed that increased lipid uptake and/or disrupted lipid metabolism led to increased lysosomal protein aggregation and, concomitantly, accumulation of sphingolipids and cholesterol esters. Surprisingly, lysosomal proteostasis impairment by lipid dysregulation is independent of lipid peroxidation or changes in lysosomal stability, nor is it caused by effects on many other aspects of lysosomal or proteasomal function. These results suggest that lipid dysregulation may have primary effects on the stability of endogenous proteins, potentially through direct biophysical mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Optogenetics is a fast-growing field, that applies light-sensitive proteins to manipulate cellular processes. A popular optogenetics tool is the improved light-induced dimer (iLID). It comprises two components, iLID and SspB, which heterodimerize upon illumination with blue light. This system is often used to recruit proteins to a specific subcellular location, e.g. by targeting the iLID to the plasma membrane. The targeting requires modification of the iLID with a targeting sequence. To skip the modification of the iLID and use existing GFP fusion as targets, we fuse an antiGFP nanobody to the iLID. We show that the antiGFP nanobody is able to locate iLID to GFP-tagged proteins. Plus, the light-dependent recruitment of SspB to iLID, localized by the antiGFP nanobody to a GFP-tagged protein, is still functioning efficiently. This approach increases flexibility, enabling the recruitment of any GFP-tagged protein, without the necessity of protein engineering."

    "abstract": "Human WASP and N-WASP are homologous proteins that require the binding of multiple regulators, including the acidic lipid PIP2 and the small GTPase Cdc42, to relieve autoinhibition before they can stimulate the initiation of actin polymerization. Autoinhibition involves intramolecular binding of the C-terminal acidic and central motifs to an upstream basic region and GTPase binding domain. Little is known about how a single intrinsically disordered protein, WASP or N-WASP, binds multiple regulators to achieve full activation. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the binding of WASP and N-WASP with PIP2 and Cdc42. In the absence of Cdc42, both WASP and N-WASP strongly associate with PIP2-containing membranes, through their basic region and also possibly through a tail portion of the N-terminal WH1 domain. The basic region also participates in Cdc42 binding, especially for WASP; consequently Cdc42 binding significantly compromises the ability of the basic region in WASP, but not N-WASP, to bind PIP2. PIP2 binding to the WASP basic region is restored only when Cdc42 is prenylated at the C-terminus and tethered to the membrane. This distinction in the activation of WASP and N-WASP may contribute to their different functional roles."

    "abstract": "Throughout its complex life cycle, the uniflagellate parasitic protist, Trypanosoma cruzi, adapts to different host environments by transitioning between elongated motile extracellular forms and non-motile intracellular amastigote forms that replicate in the cytoplasm of mammalian host cells. Despite their name, intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes retain a short flagellum that extends beyond the opening of the flagellar pocket with access to the extracellular milieu. Contrary to the long-held view that the T. cruzi amastigote flagellum is inert, we now report that this organelle is motile and displays quasiperiodic beating inside mammalian host cells. Kymograph analysis determined an average flagellar beat frequency of ~0.7 Hz for intracellular amastigotes. Similar beat frequencies were measured in extracellular amastigotes following their isolation from host cells. Inhibitor studies reveal roles for parasite mitochondrial respiration and intracellular calcium availability in modulating flagellar beat in T. cruzi amastigotes. Together, these findings demonstrate that flagellar motility is an intrinsic property of T. cruzi amastigotes and suggest that this organelle may play an active role in the parasite infection process. To our knowledge, this is the first record of an intracellular eukaryotic flagellum beating within another eukaryotic cell."

Due to surface tension effects, the critical solubility can be higher than the saturation concentration for small, curved nuclei. Kinetically, PS is characterized by the primary nucleation rate constant and a combined rate constant accounting for growth and secondary nucleation. It is demonstrated that the formation of a few number of large condensates is possible without active mechanisms of size control and in the absence of coalescence phenomena.

It can be considered a language translation problem, i.e., translating a sequence of 20 different amino acids into a sequence of secondary structure symbols (e.g., alpha helix, beta strand, and coil). Here, we develop a novel protein secondary structure predictor called TransPross based on the transformer network and attention mechanism widely used in natural language processing to directly extract the evolutionary information from the protein language (i.e., raw multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of a protein) to predict the secondary structure. The method is different from traditional methods that first generate a MSA and then calculate expert-curated statistical profiles from the MSA as input. The attention mechnism used by TransPross can effectively capture long-range residue-residue interactions in protein sequences to predict secondary structures. Benchmarked on several datasets, TransPross outperforms the state-of-art methods. Moreover, our experiment shows that the prediction accuracy of TransPross positively correlates with the depth of MSAs and it is able to achieve the average prediction accuracy (i.e., Q3 score) above 80% for hard targets with few homologous sequences in their MSAs.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that ~500-year-old GaoHuaHua individuals are most closely related to West Hmongic-speaking Bunu. The excessive level of the genetic bottleneck of HM speakers, especially Bunu, is in agreement with their long-term practice of slash-and-burn agriculture. The inferred admixture dates in most of the HM-speaking populations overlap the reign of the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644 CE). Besides the common genetic origin of HM speakers, their external ancestry majorly comes from neighboring Han Chinese and Kra-Dai speakers in South China. Conclusively, our analysis reveals the recent isolation and admixture events that contribute to the fine-scale genetic formation of present-day HM-speaking populations underrepresented in previous studies."

    "abstract": "Adult neurogenic decline, inflammation, and neurodegeneration are phenotypic hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD). Mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) in heterochromatic regions was recently reported in AD, but the underlying mechanisms are still underappreciated. Combining functional genomics with differentiation of familial and sporadic AD patient derived-iPSCs into hippocampal progenitors, CA3 neurons, and cerebral organoids, we found that upregulation of the AP-1 subunit c-JUN triggers decondensation of genomic regions containing TEs. This leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of TE-derived RNA-DNA hybrids, activation of the cGAS-STING cascade, and increased cleaved caspase-3 levels, suggesting initiation of programmed cell death in progenitor cells and neurons. Notably, inhibiting c-JUN effectively blocks all the downstream molecular processes and rescues neuronal death and impaired neurogenesis in the AD progenitors. Our findings open new avenues for identifying therapeutic strategies and biomarkers to counteract disease progression and diagnose AD in the early, pre-symptomatic stages."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by long bone overgrowth, enlargement of the aorta, ocular anomalies and other symptoms. Current treatment focuses on managing aortic aneurysms to avoid dissection or rupture. However, no cures are available. MFS is caused by one of >1,800 dominant pathogenic variants in FBN1, which encodes the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibrillin-1. A significant number of FBN1 variants result in premature termination codons (PTCs). Recently, small molecules were identified that can promote translational readthrough of PTCs and were evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for several genetic disorders. Here, we show that the translational readthrough drugs ataluren and gentamicin ameliorated FBN1 deposition in some MFS patient-derived skin fibroblast lines harboring PTC variants in FBN1. In contrast, inhibitors of NMD were cytotoxic to the skin fibroblast lines that we analyzed. We conclude that promoting translational readthrough of PTC variants in FBN1 could result in a therapeutic benefit for MFS patients with specific PTCs in FBN1 and that its efficacy will likely depend on the PTC sequence context, the amino acids that are incorporated in FBN1 after PTC suppression and the overall increase of FBN1 deposition in the ECM."

TERRAs are essential for the establishment of heterochromatin marks at telomeres, which serve for the binding of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a protein family of epigenetic modifiers involved with chromatin compaction and gene silencing. While HP1{gamma} is enriched on gene bodies of actively transcribed human and mouse genes, it is unclear if its transcriptional role is important for HP1{gamma} function in telomere cohesion and telomere maintenance. We aimed to study the effect of mouse HP1{gamma} on the transcription of telomere factors and molecules that can affect telomere maintenance.\n\nMain methodsWe investigated the telomere function of HP1{gamma} by using deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deriving from 13.5 embryonic day embryos compared to their litter mate controls. We used gene expression analysis of HP1{gamma} deficient MEFs and validated the molecular and mechanistic consequences of HP1{gamma} loss by telomere FISH, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR and DNA-RNA Immunoprecipitation (DRIP).\n\nKey findingsLoss of HP1{gamma} in primary MEFs leads to a downregulation of various telomere and telomere-accessory transcripts, including shelterin protein TRF1. Its downregulation is associated with increased telomere replication stress and DNA damage ({gamma}H2AX), effects more profound in females. We suggest that the source for the impaired telomere maintenance is a consequence of increased telomeric DNA-RNA hybrids and TERRAs arising at and from mouse chromosomes 18 and X.\n\nSignificanceOur results suggest an important transcriptional control by mouse HP1{gamma} of various telomere factors including TRF1 protein and TERRAs that has profound consequences on telomere stability, with a potential sexually dimorphic nature."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rap1 to promote cell adhesion. Resting C3G is autoinhibited and the GEF activity is released by stimuli that signal through tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and interaction with Crk adaptor proteins, whose expression is increased in multiple human cancers, participate in C3G activation. However, the molecular details of C3G activation and the interplay between C3G phosphorylation and Crk interaction are poorly understood. Here, we combine biochemical, biophysical, and cell biology approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of C3G activation. CrkL interacts through its SH3N domain with the proline-rich motifs P1 and P2 of inactive C3G in vitro and in Jurkat and HEK293T cells, and these sites are necessary to recruit C3G to the plasma membrane. However, direct stimulation of the GEF activity requires binding of Crk proteins to the P3 and P4 sites. P3 is occluded in resting C3G and is essential for activation, while P4 contributes secondarily towards complete stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G alone causes marginal activation. Instead, phosphorylation primes C3G lowering the concentration of Crk proteins required for activation and increasing the maximum activity. Unexpectedly, optimal activation also requires the interaction of CrkL-SH2 domain with phosphorylated C3G. Phosphorylation and Crk-binding form a two-factor mechanism that ensures tight control of C3G activation. The simultaneous SH2 and SH3N interaction of CrkL with C3G, required for the activation, reveals a novel adaptor-independent function of Crk proteins relevant to understanding their role in physiological signaling and their deregulation in diseases."

DNA methylation is an important regulatory mechanism on gene expression, providing a key angle to understand disease mechanisms. To understand the pathways involved in SLE, and to develop biomarkers for its diagnosis and treatment, we analyzed DNA methylation profiles on blood cells from SLE patients and healthy controls.\n\nResultsWe identified most differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in T cells, while majority of differentially variable sites (DVSs) were found in B cells, featuring hypervariability in enhancers. We observed a prominent T cell receptor (TCR) signaling cluster with consistent hypermethylation and a B cell receptor (BCR) cluster with highly increased variability in SLE. Genes involved in innate immunity were often found hypomethylated, while adaptive immunity genes were featured with hypermethylation. Using a machine learning approach, we identified 60 genes that accurately distinguished SLE patients from healthy individuals, which also showed correlation with disease activities.\n\nConclusionsThis study highlights the role of lymphocyte receptor aberrations in the disease and identified a list of genes showing great potential as biomarkers and shedding new light on disease mechanisms, through novel analyses of methylation data."

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning is a family of related approaches that learn low-dimensional vector representations of nodes and other graph elements called embeddings. Embeddings approximate characteristics of the graph and can be used for a variety of machine-learning tasks such as novel edge prediction. For many biomedical applications, partial knowledge exists about positive edges that represent relationships between pairs of entities, but little to no knowledge is available about negative edges that represent the explicit lack of a relationship between two nodes. For this reason, classification procedures are forced to assume that the vast majority of unlabeled edges are negative. Existing approaches to sampling negative edges for training and evaluating classifiers do so by uniformly sampling pairs of nodes. We show here that this sampling strategy typically leads to sets of positive and negative edges with imbalanced edge degree distributions. Using representative homogeneous and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs, we show that this strategy artificially inflates measured classification performance. We present a degree-aware node sampling approach for sampling negative edge examples that mitigates this effect and is simple to implement."

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the primary histological form of lung cancer, accounts for about 25% - the highest - of all cancer deaths. As NSCLC is often undetected until symptoms appear in the late stages, it is imperative to discover more effective tumor-associated biomarkers for early diagnosis. Topological data analysis is one of the most powerful methodologies applicable to biological networks. However, current studies fail to consider the biological significance of their quantitative methods and utilize popular scoring metrics without verification, leading to low performance. To extract meaningful insights from genomic data, it is essential to understand the relationship between geometric correlations and biological function mechanisms. Through bioinformatics and network analyses, we propose a novel composite selection index, the C-Index, that best captures significant pathways and interactions in gene networks to identify biomarkers with the highest efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we establish a 4-gene biomarker signature that serves as a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC and personalized medicine. We designed a Cascading machine learning model to validate both the C-Index and the biomarkers discovered. The methodology proposed for finding top metrics can be applied to effectively select biomarkers and early diagnose many diseases, revolutionizing the approach to topological network research for all cancers."

    "abstract": "A terrace in a phylogenetic tree space is a region where all trees contain the same set of subtrees, due to certain patterns of missing data among the taxa sampled, resulting in an identical optimality score for a given data set. This was first investigated in the context of phylogenetic tree estimation from sequence alignments using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP). The concept of terraces was later extended to the species tree inference problem from a collection of gene trees, where a set of equally optimal species trees was referred to as a \"pseudo\" species tree terrace. Pseudo terraces do not consider the topological proximity of the trees in terms of the induced subtrees resulting from certain patterns of missing data. In this study, we mathematically characterize species tree terraces and investigate the mathematical properties and conditions that lead multiple species trees to induce/display an identical set of locus-specific subtrees owing to missing data, therefore, as a consequence of combinatorial structure, resulting in the same optimality score. We present analytical results and combinatorial characteristics of species tree terraces. We report that species tree terraces are agnostic to gene tree topologies and the discordance therein, considering which is central to developing statistically consistent species tree estimation techniques using gene tree distributions. Therefore, we introduce and characterize a special type of gene tree topology-aware terrace which we call \"peak terrace\", highlight its impact and importance in species tree inference, and investigate conditions on the patterns of missing data that give rise to peak terraces."

During the immune response, the interactions between peptides and major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) play an important role as peptides must be bound and presented by MHC to be recognised by the immune system. However, only limited experimentally determined peptide-MHC (pMHC) structures are available, and in-silico structure modelling is therefore used for studying their interactions. Current approaches mainly use Monte Carlo sampling and energy minimisation, and are often computationally expensive. On the other hand, the advent of large high-quality proteomic data sets has led to an unprecedented opportunity for deep learning-based methods with pMHC structure prediction becoming feasible with these trained protein folding models. In this work, we present a graph neural network-based model for pMHC structure prediction, which takes an amino acid-level pMHC graph and an atomic-level peptide graph as inputs and predicts the peptide backbone conformation. With a novel weighted reconstruction loss, the trained model achieved a similar accuracy to AlphaFold 2, requiring only 1.7M learnable parameters compared to 93M, representing a more than 98% reduction in the number of required parameters."

The risk scores in the Female reproductive group and Lung group were internally and externally validated. In the Female reproductive group, CDKN2A, FN1 and ITGA5, were identified as hub genes associated with poor prognosis, while IL2RB and LEF1 were associated with favorable prognosis. In the Lung group, ITGB1 and LDHA were associated with poor prognosis, and GLS2 was associated with favorable prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the Female reproductive group was enriched in terms related to cilia and skin, while the Lung group was enriched in terms related to cytokines and defense.

These characteristic mutations originate from specific lesions caused by these chemicals to the DNA of exposed cells. However, it is unknown whether the exposure to these chemotherapies leads to a specific footprint of larger chromosomal aberrations. Here, we address this question exploiting whole genome sequencing data of metastatic tumors obtained from patients exposed to different chemotherapeutic drugs. As a result, we discovered a specific copy number footprint across tumors from patients previously exposed to platinum-based therapies. This footprint is characterized by a significant increase in the number of chromosomal fragments of copy number 1-4 and size smaller than 10 Mb in exposed tumors with respect to their unexposed counterparts (median 14-387% greater across tumor types). The number of chromosomal fragments characteristic of the platinum-associated CN footprint increases significantly with the activity of the well known platinum-related footprint of single nucleotide variants across exposed tumors."

Using >1.5M single cells from 383 single-cell RNAseq and single-cell ATAC-seq data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. In addition, SComatic permits the estimation of mutational burdens and de novo mutational signature analysis at single-cell and cell-type resolution. Notably, using matched exome and single-cell RNAseq data, we show that SComatic achieves a 20 to 40-fold increase in precision as compared to existing algorithms for somatic SNV calling without compromising sensitivity. Overall, SComatic opens the possibility to study somatic mutagenesis at unprecedented scale and resolution using high-throughput single-cell profiling data sets."

    "abstract": "Chronic exposure to the Cyanobacteria biotoxin Beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been associated with development of a sporadic form of ALS called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC), as observed within certain Indigenous populations of Guam and Japan. Studies in primate models and cell culture have supported the association of BMAA with ALS/PDC, yet the pathological mechanisms at play remain incompletely characterized, effectively stalling the development of rationally-designed therapeutics or application of preventative measures for this disease. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that sub-excitotoxic doses of BMAA modulate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to drive cellular defects in human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting a potential mechanism by which BMAA may promote neurological disease. Further, we demonstrate here that the effects of BMAA can be reversed in cell culture by use of pharmacological modulators of the Wnt pathway, revealing the potential value of targeting this pathway therapeutically. Interestingly, our results suggest the existence of a distinct Wnt-independent mechanism activated by BMAA in glioblastoma cells, highlighting the likelihood that neurological disease may result from the cumulative effects of distinct cell-type specific mechanisms of BMAA toxicity."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly applied to predicting the development of sepsis and multiple organ failure. While there has been success in demonstrating the clinical utility of such systems in terms of affecting various outcomes, there are fundamental challenges to the ML/AI approach in terms of improving the actual predictive performance and future robustness of such systems. Given that one of the primary proposed avenues for improving algorithmic performance is the addition of molecular/biomarker/genetic features to the data used to train these systems, the overall sparsity of such available data suggests the need to generate synthetic data to aid in training, as has been the case in numerous other ML/AI tasks, such as image recognition/generation and text analysis/generation. We propose the need to generate synthetic molecular/mediator time series data coincides with the advent of the concept of medical digital twins, specifically related to interpretations of medical digital twins that hew closely to the original description and use of industrial digital twins, which involve simulating multiple individual twins from a common computational model specification. Herein we present an example of generating synthetic time series data of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines using the Critical Illness Digital Twin (CIDT) regarding the development of post-traumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "abstract": "Many Cryo-EM datasets contain structural heterogeneity due to functional or nonfunctional dynamics that conventional reconstruction methods may fail to resolve. Here we propose a new method, OPUS-DSD (Deep Structural Disentanglement), which can reliably reconstruct the structural landscape of cryo-EM data by directly translating the 2D cryo-EM images into 3D structures. The method adopts a convolutional neural network and is regularized by a latent space prior that encourages the encoding of structural information. The performance of OPUS-DSD was systematically compared to a previously reported method, cryoDRGN, on synthetic and real cryo-EM data. It consistently outperformed existing methods, resolved large or small structural heterogeneity, and improved the final reconstructions of tested systems even on highly noisy cryo-EM data. The results have shown that OPUS-DSD should be particularly suitable for cases in which the high structural flexibilities cannot easily be represented by rigid-body movements. Therefore, OPUS-DSD represents a valuable tool that can not only recover functionally-important structural dynamics missed in a traditional cryo-EM refinement, but also improve the final reconstruction by increasing homogeneity in a dataset. OPUS-DSD is available at https://github.com/alncat/opusDSD."

    "abstract": "Spatially-resolved gene expression profiling provides valuable insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for a rigorous interpretation of cell states and do not utilize associated histology images. Significant sample variation further complicates the integration of ST datasets, which is essential for identifying commonalities across tissues or altered cellular wiring in disease. Here, we present Starfysh, the first comprehensive computational toolbox for joint modeling of ST and histology data, dissection of refined cell states, and systematic integration of multiple ST datasets from complex tissues. Starfysh uses an auxiliary deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell state markers to avoid the need for a single-cell-resolution reference in characterizing known or novel tissue-specific cell states. Additionally, Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues by leveraging histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial \"hubs\" across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tumors using Starfysh led to the identification of heterogeneous patient- and disease-specific hubs as well as a shared stromal hub with varying spatial orientation. Our results show the ability to delineate the spatial co-evolution of tumor and immune cell states and their crosstalk underlying intratumoral heterogeneity in TNBC and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC. Starfysh is publicly available (https://github.com/azizilab/starfysh)."

    "abstract": "The process of finding molecules that bind to a target protein is a challenging first step in drug discovery. Crystallographic fragment screening is a strategy based on elucidating binding modes of small polar compounds and then building potency by expanding or merging them. Recent advances in high-throughput crystallography enable screening of large fragment libraries, reading out dense ensembles of fragments spanning the binding site. However, fragments typically have low affinity thus the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Here, we take advantage of high-throughput crystallography to reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem - identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from a fragment ensemble amid noise due to weak binders - and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. Our method screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We retrospectively validated our approach on an open science campaign against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), showing that our method can distinguish active compounds from inactive ones using only structural data of fragment-protein complexes, without any activity data. Further, we prospectively found novel hits for Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3. More broadly, our results demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning helps interpret high throughput crystallography data to rapidly discover of potent chemical modulators of protein function."

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 protease is one of several common key targets of combination drug therapies for human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). During the progression of the disease, some individual patients acquire -drug resistance due to mutational hotspots on the viral proteins targeted by combination drug therapies. It has recently been discovered that drug-resistant mutations accumulate on the  flap region of the HIV-1 protease, which is a critical dynamic region involved in non-specific polypeptide binding during invasion and infection of the host cell. In this study, we utilize machine learning assisted comparative molecular dynamics, conducted at single amino acid site resolution, to investigate the dynamic changes that occur during functional dimerization and polypeptide binding of the main protease. We use a multi-agent machine learning model to identify conserved dynamics of the HIV-1 main protease that are preserved across simian and feline protease orthologs (SIV and FIV). We also investigate changes in dynamics due to common drug-resistant mutations in many patients. We find that a key functional site in the flap region, a solvent-exposed isoleucine (ILE50) and surrounding sites that control flap dynamics is often targeted by drug-resistance mutations, likely leading to malfunctional molecular dynamics affecting the overall flexibility of the flap region. We conclude that better long term patient outcomes may be achieved by designing drugs that target protease regions which are less dependent upon single sites with large functional binding effects."

    "abstract": "ReadUntil enables Oxford Nanopore Technologys (ONT) sequencers to selectively sequence reads of target species in real-time. This enables efficient microbial enrichment for applications such as microbial abundance estimation and is particularly beneficial for metagenomic samples with a very high fraction of non-target reads (> 99% can be human reads). Read-until, however, requires a fast and accurate software filter that analyzes a short prefix of a read and determines if it belongs to a microbe of interest (target) or not. The baseline Read Until pipeline uses a deep neural network-based basecaller called Guppy and is slow and inaccurate for this task (~60% of bases sequenced are unclassified). We present RawMap, an efficient CPU-only microbial species-agnostic Read Until classifier for filtering non-target human reads in the squiggle space. RawMap uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is trained to distinguish human from microbe using non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of ONTs squiggle output (continuous electrical signals). Compared to the baseline Read Until pipeline, RawMap is 1327X faster and significantly improve the sequencing time and cost, and compute time savings. We show that RawMap augmented pipelines reduce sequencing time and cost by 23.79% and computing cost by ~22%. Additionally, since RawMap is agnostic to microbial species, it can also classify microbial species it is not trained on.\n\nWe also discuss how RawMap may be used as an alternative to the RT-PCR test for viral load quantification of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAvailability and implementationSoftware is released with MIT License and available on GitHub: https://github.com/harisankarsadasivan/RawMap"

To overcome the hurdle of connecting drugs and diseases through large and dense gene-gene network and simultaneously realize the concept of \"semantic multi-layer GBA\", we present a random walk-based algorithm with a novel clinical-knowledge guided teleport. As a result, drug-disease association prediction accuracy increased up to 8.7% compared to existing state-of-the-art models. In addition, exploration of the generated embedding space displays harmony between biological and clinical contexts.

    "abstract": "Maximising FAIRness of biosimulation models requires a comprehensive description of model entities such as reactions, variables, and components. The COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community encourages the use of RDF with composite annotations that semantically involve ontologies to ensure completeness and accuracy. These annotations facilitate scientists to find models or detailed information to inform further reuse, such as model composition, reproduction, and curation. SPARQL has been recommended as a key standard to access semantic annotation with RDF, which helps get entities precisely. However, SPARQL is not suitable for most repository users who explore biosimulation models freely without adequate knowledge regarding ontologies, RDF structure, and SPARQL syntax. We propose here a text-based information retrieval approach, CASBERT, that is easy to use and can present candidates of relevant entities from models across a repositorys contents. CASBERT adapts Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), where each composite annotation about an entity is converted into an entity embedding for subsequent storage in a list-like structure. For entity lookup, a query is transformed to a query embedding and compared to the entity embeddings, and then the entities are displayed in order based on their similarity. The simple list-like structure makes it possible to implement CASBERT as an efficient search engine product, with inexpensive addition, modification, and insertion of entity embedding. To demonstrate and test CASBERT, we created a dataset for testing from the Physiome Model Repository and a static export of the BioModels database consisting of query-entities pairs. Measured using Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank, we found that our approach can perform better than the traditional bag-of-words method."

In this work we provide a general method for data collection, preprocessing, splitting and generation of negative examples, as well as comprehensive datasets to compare TCR-pMHC prediction models. We collected, harmonized, and merged all the major publicly available TCR-pMHC binding data and compared the performance of five state-of-the-art deep learning models (TITAN, NetTCR, ERGO, DLpTCR and ImRex) using this data. Our performance evaluation focuses on two scenarios: 1) different splitting methods for generating training and testing data to assess model generalization and 2) different data versions that vary in size and peptide imbalance to assess model robustness. Our results indicate that the five contemporary models do not generalize to peptides that have not been in the training set. We can also show that model performance is strongly dependent on the data balance and size, which indicates a relatively low model robustness. These results suggest that TCR-pMHC binding prediction remains highly challenging and requires further high quality data and novel algorithmic approaches."

    "date": "2022-11-24",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "In the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the periadventitial injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has shown significant potential in improving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation by inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia (NIH). However, the rapid clearance of MSCs remains a challenge. Hence, we fabricated an electrospun perivascular scaffold from polycaprolactone (PCL) to support MSC attachment and allow gradual MSC elution at the outflow vein, the AVF site most prone to NIH. We performed 5/6th nephrectomy to induce CKD in Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by direct AVF formation and perivascular scaffold application. We then compared the following groups of CKD rats: no perivascular scaffold (i.e., control), PCL scaffold, and PCL+MSC scaffold. On ultrasonography, the PCL and PCL+MSC groups showed significantly reduced wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio and increased luminal diameter and flow rate. Of note, PCL+MSC group showed greater improvement in luminal diameter and flow rate compared to PCL alone. Moreover, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed that only PCL+MSC resulted in a significant reduction in uptake. On histology, the PCL and PCL+MSC groups showed significantly reduced neointima-to-lumen and neointima-to- media ratios and reduced neointimal CD45, -SMA, and vimentin fluorescence staining compared to control. Although the two scaffold treatments did not differ significantly in histology, in vivo imaging suggested that addition of MSCs promoted greater luminal expansion and blood flow and reduced the inflammatory process underlying NIH. Our results demonstrate the utility of a mechanical support loaded with MSCs at the outflow vein immediately after AVF formation to support maturation by minimizing NIH.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL STATEMENTCurrent strategies to improve rates of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation by minimizing neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) remain insufficient. Here, we pioneered a bioresorbable electrospun polymeric scaffold to deliver mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the outflow vein, the site most prone to NIH in AVFs. This approach increased luminal diameter and flow rate and decreased inflammation and neointimal thickening, as seen on ultrasonography, 18F-FDG-PET, and histology. This study provides a foundation for the development and clinical use of MSC-seeded perivascular scaffolds that could improve AVF patency outcomes, reduce salvage interventions, and eventually reduce morbidity and mortality associated with vascular access failure."

    "abstract": "Spatially resolved proteomics requires a highly multiplexed imaging modality. Cyclic imaging techniques, which repeat staining, imaging, and signal erasure, have been adopted for this purpose. However, due to tissue distortion, it is challenging to obtain high fluorescent signal intensities and complete signal erasure in thick tissue with cyclic imaging techniques. Here, we propose an \"erasureless\" cyclic imaging method named IMPASTO. In IMPASTO, specimens are iteratively stained and imaged without signal erasure. Then, images from two consecutive rounds are unmixed to retrieve the images of single proteins through self-supervised machine learning without any prior training. Using IMPASTO, we demonstrate 30-plex imaging from brain slices in 10 rounds, and when used in combination with spectral unmixing, in five rounds. We show that IMPASTO causes negligible tissue distortion and demonstrate 3D multiplexed imaging of brain slices. Further, we show that IMPASTO can shorten the signal removal processes of existing cyclic imaging techniques."

    "abstract": "ObjectiveUltrasound can detect individual motor unit (MU) activity during voluntary isometric contractions based on their subtle axial displacements. The detection pipeline, currently performed offline, is based on displacement velocity images and identifying the subtle axial displacements. This identification can preferably be made through a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm with the feasibility of translating the pipeline from offline to online. However, the question remains how to reduce the computational time for the BSS algorithm, which includes demixing tissue velocities from many different sources, e.g., the active MU displacements, arterial pulsations, bones, connective tissue, and noise.\n\nApproachThis study proposes a fast velocity-based BSS (velBSS) algorithm suitable for online purposes that decomposes velocity images from low-force voluntary isometric contractions into spatiotemporal components associated with single MU activities. The proposed algorithm will be compared against stICA, i.e., the method used in previous papers, for various subjects, ultrasound- and EMG systems, where the latter acts as MU reference recordings.\n\nMain resultsWe found that the spatial and temporal correlation between the MU-associated components from velBSS and stICA was high (0.86 {+/-} 0.05 and 0.87 {+/-} 0.06). The spike-triggered averaged twitch responses (using the MU spike trains from EMG) had an extremely high correlation (0.99 {+/-} 0.01). In addition, the computational time for velBSS was at least 50 times less than for stICA.\n\nSignificanceThe present algorithm (velBSS) outperforms the currently available method (stICA). It provides a promising translation towards an online pipeline and will be important in the continued development of this research field of functional neuromuscular imaging."

    "abstract": "Drugs based on cytokine genes increase the bodys immunity against cancer and several viral diseases. Cytokines such as CCL21 and CCL19 specifically bind to the CCR7 receptor and have anti-tumor properties and a prognosis of tumorigenesis. An epitope of IL-I{beta} is also involved in various cellular activities such as neutrophil activation, T and B lymphocyte cell production, antibody production, and fibroblast proliferation. They bind to secretory proteins without any inflammatory response. GM-CSF adjuvant is one of the growth factors of white blood cells (WBC) that stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes and myocytes. In our project, we designed and synthesized codon-optimized multiepitope genes construct from human genes. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding affinity of this recombinant protein and CCR7 receptor were examined through in silico analyses. This construct was introduced into the pET-28a vector that was cloned in Ecoli to explore this recombinant protein. The purified multiepitope protein produced a strong signal in Dot-blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western-blot assays comparable to the positive control. The assessments of FTIR measurement and MALDI-TOF MS displayed that synthetic gene constructs correctly be expressed in E. coli. We also investigated the potential activity of the purified multiepitope protein in stimulating migration and proliferation of MCF7CCR7+ cancer cell line using wound healing assay. Also, in this study, the MTT method was used to determine the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of all multiepitope protein concentrations. We used Agarose assay on PBMCsCCR7+ to observe whether PBMC cells and chemoattractants attract to each other. Also, we found that intraperitoneal injection of recombinant antigen affected the level of WBC in BALB/c mice, and the level of WBC in tumor mice increased significantly compared to healthy mice. Our project aims to produce the first multi-epitope vaccine with many beneficial advantages such as low-cost price and any major or significant complications that can be used as biomarkers for cancer screening and prognosis tests to immunize the patient before chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "Epithelial tissues sheath many organs, separating  outside from  inside and exquisitely regulating ion and water transport via electromechanical pumping to maintain homeostatic balance and tissue hydrostatic pressure. While it is becoming increasingly clear that the ionic microenvironment and external electric stimuli can affect epithelial function and behavior, the coupling between electrical perturbation and tissue form remain unclear. We investigated this by combining electrical stimulation with three-dimensional epithelial tissues with hollow  lumens--both kidney cysts and complex intestinal stem cell organoids. Our core finding is that physiological strength electrical stimulation of order 1-3 V/cm (with both direct and alternating currents) can drive powerful and rapid inflation of hollow tissues through a process we call  electro-inflation, inducing a nearly three-fold increase in tissue volume and striking asymmetries in tissue form. Electro-inflation is primarily driven by activation of the CFTR ion channel pumping chloride into the tissue, causing water to osmotically flow. This influx generates hydrostatic pressure, and inflation results from a competition between this pressure and cell cytoskeletal tension. We validated these interpretations with computational models connecting ion dynamics in the Diffuse Double Layer around tissues to tissue mechanics. Electro-inflation is a unique biophysical process to study and control complex tissue function."

    "abstract": "IntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death globally. Genome-wide association studies have established that cancer risk mediated through common genetic variants can be linked to variation in gene expression. Since obesity and male sex impart substantially elevated CRC risk, we studied transcriptional profiles of normal colorectal mucosa using RNA sequencing to better understand the relationship of these risk factors with gene expression levels.\n\nMethodsNormal colorectal mucosa was sampled from 365 participants (208 males, 157 females) either during surgery (n=103) or through endoscopic biopsy (n=262) from cancer patients and patients with other unrelated conditions. In total, 238 samples were used for our discovery dataset and 380 samples were obtained for the validation of our findings. The transcription analysis was done using paired-end total RNA sequencing. Data processing and gene filtering followed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project pipeline v8. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) was performed on normalised counts to evaluate effects of sex and body mass index on the total gene expression, as well as possible confounding effects of cancer presence on the gene expression in normal colorectal tissue.\n\nResultsFollowing filtering, there were 15,465 genes available for analysis. DEA identified two genes that were significantly associated with sex and five associated with body mass index. However, whilst these nominal signals are of interest, none of the genes associated with sex remained significant in a replication dataset. Due to the missing BMI information, replication of DEA by BMI was not possible.\n\nConclusionWe found no systematic differences in gene expression in normal colorectal epithelium between males and females, nor did we find a strong association between gene expression and BMI. Although sample size may limit our analysis, the results suggest no or limited confounding effects of BMI and sex on gene expression in normal colorectal mucosa samples."

In addition, genotype-environment interactions (GxE) contribute to complex traits such as cardiovascular disease. Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant and is known to produce a vascular response. To investigate GxE for caffeine, we treated vascular endothelial cells with caffeine and used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure allelic effects on gene regulation for over 43,000 genetic variants. We identified 9,102 variants with allelic effects on gene regulation and 7,152 variants that regulate the gene expression response to caffeine (GxE, FDR<10%). When overlapping our GxE results with fine-mapped artery eQTLs, we dissected their regulatory mechanisms and showed a modulatory role for caffeine. Our results demonstrate that massively parallel reporter assay is a powerful approach to identify and molecularly characterize GxE in the specific context of caffeine consumption."

The annotation of TEs is a critical part of our understanding of genomes, however, the accuracy of gene/TE annotation pipelines remains an issue as TEs are frequently underestimated or misannotated. In this paper, we report that the mammalian General Transcription Factor II-I Repeat Domain-Containing Protein 2 (GTF2IRD2) was used to erroneously annotate DNA transposons in a variety of non-mammalian species because the transcription factor contains a 3 fused hAT transposase domain. The consequences of the misannotation of TEs as trans-regulatory elements such as transcription factors can lead to errors in phylogenetic trees based on orthologs and to significant wasted time for investigators interested in gene regulation. This study reiterates the importance of structural analysis and effective annotation methods that minimise transitive error propagation when characterising non-mammalian genomes."

    "abstract": "We have investigated the time course of genome-wide transcription in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp. So ce836 in relation to its production of natural compounds. Time-resolved RNA sequencing revealed that core biosynthesis genes from 48 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs; 92% of all BGCs encoded in the genome) were actively transcribed at specific time points in a batch culture. The majority (80%) of polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes displayed distinct peaks of transcription during exponential bacterial growth. Strikingly, these bursts in BGC transcriptional activity were associated with surges in the production of known natural compounds, indicating that their biosynthesis was critially regulated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, BGC read counts from single time points had limited predictive value about biosynthetic activity, since transcription levels varied >100-fold among BGCs with detected natural products. Taken together, our time-course data provide unique insights into the dynamics of natural compound biosynthesis and its regulation in a wild-type myxobacterium, challenging the commonly cited notion of preferential BGC expression under nutrient-limited conditions. The close association observed between BGC transcription and compound production warrants additional efforts to develop genetic engineering tools for myxobacterial producer strains, to boost compound yields by manipulating transcriptional activity."

Inbred mouse strains exhibit substantial and heritable differences in the extent of voluntary cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Computational genetic analysis of IVSA data obtained from an inbred strain panel identified Nav1, a member of the neuron navigator family that regulates dendrite formation and axonal guidance, as a candidate gene. To test this hypothesis, we generated and characterized Nav1 knockout (KO) mice. Nav1 KO mice exhibited increased cocaine intake during IVSA testing. Surprisingly, Nav1 KO mice also displayed a reduced susceptibility to become opioid dependent or develop opioid-induced hyperalgesia after chronic morphine administration, and had impaired spatial learning/memory. Immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology studies revealed that inhibitory synapse density in the cortex of Nav1 KO mice was reduced, and excitatory synaptic transmission was increased in the Nav1 KO cortex and hippocampus. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Nav1 KO mice had a marked increase in excitatory neurons in a deep cortical layer. Collectively, our results indicate that Nav1 regulates learning, memory, and the response to multiple addictive drugs, and that changes in the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic balance in the cortex and hippocampus could possibly mediate these phenotypic effects."

    "abstract": "Growing hair follicles (HFs) harbor actively dividing transit amplifying cells (TACs), rendering them highly sensitive to radiotherapy (RT). Clinically, there is still a lack of effective treatment for radiotherapy-induced alopecia (RIA). We aimed to dissect the effect and mechanism of local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pretreatment in RIA prevention. We found that PGE2 pretreatment reduced RIA by preventing premature termination of anagen through enhancing HF self-repair.\n\nMechanistically, PGE2 did not activate HF stem cells, but preserved more TACs for regenerative attempts. Pretreatment of PGE2 lessened radiosensitivity of TACs by transiently arresting them in the G1 phase, thereby reducing TAC apoptosis and mitigating HF dystrophy. The preservation of more TACs accelerated HF self-repair and bypassed RT-induced premature catagen entry. Promoting G1 arrest by systemic administration of palbociclib isethionate (PD0332991), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, offered a similar protective effect against RT. Therefore, PGE2 protects HF TACs from RT by transiently inducing G1 arrest, and the regeneration of HF structures lost from RT is accelerated to resume anagen growth, thus bypassing the long downtime of hair loss. PGE2 has the potential to be repurposed as a preventive treatment for RIA."

We apply this approach to present an unbiased characterization of the human islet microenvironment comprising the entire complex array of tissues involved while maintaining spatial information and the degree of the islets sphere of influence. We identify specific functional activity unique to the pancreatic islet cells and demonstrate how far their signature can be measured. Our results show that we can distinguish pancreatic islet cells from the neighboring exocrine tissue environment, recapitulate known biological functions of islet cells, and identify a spatial gradient in the expression of RNA processing proteins within the islet microenvironment."

These two types of modeling are rarely combined, missing the opportunity to explore possibly causal but data-driven new knowledge while explaining what is already known. Here, we explore a combination of machine learning with mechanistic modeling methods to develop computational models that could more fully represent cell-line-specific drug responses. In this proposed framework, machine learning/statistical models built using omics datasets provide high confidence predictions for new interactions between genes and proteins where there is physicochemical uncertainty. These possibly new interactions are used as new connections (edges) in a large-scale mechanistic model (called SPARCED) to better recapitulate the recently released NIH LINCS Consortium large-scale MCF10A dataset. As a test case, we focused on incorporating novel IFN{gamma}/PD-L1 related associations into the SPARCED model to enable description of the cellular response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies. This work is a template for combining big data, machine-learning-inferred interactions with mechanistic models, which could be more broadly applicable towards building multi-scale precision medicine and whole cell models."

    "abstract": "The non-random distribution of alleles of common genomic variants produces haplotypes, which are fundamental in medical and population genomic studies. Consequently, protein-coding genes with different co-occurring sets of alleles can encode different amino acid sequences: protein haplotypes. These protein haplotypes are present in biological samples, and detectable by mass spectrometry, but are not accounted for in proteomic searches. Consequently, the impact of haplotypic variation on the results of proteomic searches, and the discoverability of peptides specific to haplotypes remain unknown. Here, we study how common genetic haplotypes influence the proteomic search space and investigate the possibility to match peptides containing multiple amino acid substitutions to a publicly available data set of mass spectra. We found that for 9.96 % of the discoverable amino acid substitutions encoded by common haplotypes, two or more substitutions may co-occur in the same peptide after tryptic digestion of the protein haplotypes. We identified 342 spectra that matched to such multi-variant peptides, and out of the 4,251 amino acid substitutions identified, 6.63 % were covered by multi-variant peptides. However, the evaluation of the reliability of these matches remains challenging, suggesting that refined error rate estimation procedures are needed for such complex proteomic searches. As these become available and the ability to analyze protein haplotypes increases, we anticipate that proteomics will provide new information on the consequences of common variation, across tissues and time."

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that single particle cryo-EM has become a powerful method of structural biology, processing cryo-EM images are challenging due to the low SNR, high-dimension and un-label nature of the data. Selecting the best subset of particle images relies on 2D classification--a process that involves iterative image alignment and clustering. This process, however, represents a major time sink, particularly when the data is massive or overly heterogeneous. Popular approaches to this process often trade its robustness for efficiency. Here, we introduced a new unsupervised 2D classification method termed RE2DC. It is built upon a highly efficient variant of{gamma} -SUP, a robust statistical cryo-EM clustering algorithm resistant to the attractor effect. To develop this efficient variant, we employed a tree-based approximation to reduce the computation complexity from O(N2) to O(N), with N as the number of images. In addition, we exploited t-SNE visualization to unveil the process of 2D classification. Our tests of RE2DC using various datasets demonstrate it is both robust and efficient, with the potential to reveal subtle structural intermediates. Using RE2DC to curate a dataset of sub-millions of COVID-19 spike particles picked from 3,511 movies only takes 8 hours, suggesting its capability of accelerating cryo-EM structural determination. Currently, RE2DC is available with both CPU and GPU versions, where the implementation only requires modest hardware resources."

    "abstract": "Intertissue RNA transport has emerged as a novel signaling mechanism. In C. elegans, this is conferred by the systemic RNAi pathway, in which the limiting step is the cellular import of extracellular RNAs via SID-1. To better understand the physiological role of systemic RNAi in vivo, we modified the function of SID-1 through loss-of-function mutation and tissue-specific overexpression of sid-1 in C. elegans. We observed that sid-1 loss-of-function mutants are as healthy as wild-type worms. Conversely, overexpression of sid-1 in intestine, muscle, or neurons rendered worms short-lived. The effects of intestinal sid-1 overexpression were reversed by silencing the components of the systemic RNAi pathway sid-1, sid-2 and sid-5, thus implicating RNA transport. Moreover, silencing the miRNA biogenesis proteins pash-1 and dcr-1 rendered the lifespan of worms with intestinal sid-1 overexpression similar to controls. Lastly, we observed that the lifespan decrease produced by tissue-specific sid-1 overexpression was dependent on the bacterial food source. Collectively, our data support the notion that systemic RNA signaling is tightly regulated, and unbalancing that process provokes a reduction in lifespan."

    "date": "2022-11-24",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Actins are filament-forming, highly-conserved proteins in eukaryotes. They are involved in essential processes in the cytoplasm and have also nuclear functions. Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) have two actin isoforms that differ from each other and from canonical actins in structure and filament-forming properties. Actin I has an essential role in motility and is fairly well characterized. The structure and function of actin II are not as well understood, but mutational analyses have revealed two essential functions in male gametogenesis and in the zygote. Here, we present expression analysis, high-resolution filament structures, and biochemical characterization of Plasmodium actin II. We show that it is expressed in male gametocytes and zygotes and associated with the nucleus in both stages in filament-like structures. Unlike actin I, actin II readily forms long filaments in vitro, and near-atomic structures in the presence or absence of jasplakinolide reveal very similar structures. Small but significant differences compared to other actins in the openness and twist, the active site, the D-loop, and the plug region contribute to filament stability. Mutational analyses suggest that long and stable filaments are necessary for male gametogenesis, while the second function in the zygote stage also requires finetuned regulation by methylation of histidine 73. Actin II polymerizes via the classical nucleation-elongation mechanism and has a critical concentration of ~0.1 M at the steady-state, like actin I and canonical actins. Similarly to actin I, dimers are a stable form of actin II at equilibrium.\n\nSignificance statementMalaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium spp., which belong to the phylum Apicomplexa. In 2020, approximately 627000 people died from nearly 241 million malaria cases registered worldwide. In contrast to other apicomplexan parasites, Plasmodium spp. encode two actin isoforms. While actin I is part of the glideosome complex, essential for locomotion, actin II is present in the mosquito stages, where it has functions in gametogenesis and in the zygote. The exact function of actin II is still unclear, and information at the molecular level is limited. We show here that actin II is associated with the nucleus in gametocytes and zygotes and performs specific functions requiring both long filaments and fine-tuning by methylation of histidine 73. We determined the structures of the filamentous form of actin II at near-atomic resolution and characterized its polymerization properties in vitro. Our study provides a molecular basis for the differences between actins of the malaria parasite and humans, as well as between the two parasite actin isoforms. Furthermore, the in vivo studies provide insights into the function of actin II in the parasite."

    "abstract": "Mitochondria in mammalian cells provide ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondrial cells promotes cancer by modifying gene expression or function. Mating introduces competing mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) gene products, leading to biological differences between males and females for diseases and disorders such as cancer. There is a significant sex bias in aging-related conditions. We aimed to investigate whether sex and age affect mitochondrial protein-coding gene expression in cancer and, if so, to determine the prognosis value in survival outcomes, stemness, and immune cell infiltrates. We compared normal versus primary tumor transcriptomes (bulk RNA-Seq) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects to test these hypotheses. Correlations between gene expression, survival, protective or risk factor, stemness, and immune cell infiltrate were performed in RStudio using UCSC Xena Shiny. Eleven mitochondrial protein-coding genes were altered in brain cancer (MT-ND2, MT-ND1, MT-ATP8, MT-ATP6, MT-CO2, MT-CYB, MT-CO3, MT-ND4L, MT-ND4, MT-ND3, MT-CO1). MT-ND5 and MT-ND6 are disproportionately expressed in female brain tissues. Mitochondrial global polymorphic expression sites of variation were more significant in the 50-59 and 60-79-year-old age groups than in the 20-49-year-old age groups. Pan-cancer survival analysis revealed a 4-component gene signature (MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-ND5, and MT-ND6) downregulated in low-grade glioma (LGG). This gene signature increased LGG overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval without sex-specific association. However, the correlation with disease-free interval survival was female-specific. The 4-component gene signature was protective in LGG but risky in thymoma cancer and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. In LGG, the 4-component gene signature positively correlated with immune monocyte, NK, and B cell infiltrates and negatively correlated with T cell CD4+ Th2, macrophage M1 and M2, myeloid dendritic cell, and neutrophil. We identified a 13-component mitochondrial protein-coding gene signature associated with stemness in kidney chromophobe. A sex-biased effect was observed in mitochondrial protein-coding for brain tissues, with a female bias. However, an aging effect with higher polymorphic site expression was observed in male tissues. We conclude that the differentially expressed mitochondrial protein-coding genes provide new insights into carcinogenesis, helping to identify new prognostic markers. The overexpression of the 4-component gene signature is associated with a better prognosis in LGG, with positive and negative correlations with immune cell infiltrates."

    "abstract": "Environmental variation across the distribution of wild species can lead to local adaptations. The Baltic Sea was formed when the Fenno-Scandian ice sheet retreated around 12 thousand years ago, creating a new brackish water habitat colonised by both marine and freshwater fish species. The European perch (Perca fluviatilis) is a predatory freshwater fish with a large geographical distribution across Eurasia, where it inhabits a wide range of environmental niches. In the Baltic Sea region it has even developed a specialised brackish water phenotype that can tolerate environmental salinity levels, which are lethal to the ancestral freshwater phenotype. However, very little is known about the colonisation history and underlying genomic mechanisms facilitating the colonisation and adaptation of perch to the Baltic Sea. Here, we use Genotyping-By-Sequencing data from six freshwater and six brackish water localities to disclose the evolutionary relationship between the freshwater and brackish water phenotype. Our results show that the brackish water perch phenotype occurs in multiple distinct genetic clusters. We find that gene flow between brackish water phenotypes with full access to the sea likely led to lower levels of differentiation and higher diversity than in freshwater phenotypes. Selection analyses suggest that genomic adaptation played a role in the colonisation of the Baltic Sea and that the top three regions under selection harbour salinity tolerance genes. We also find a link between the historic salinity of the Baltic Sea and the demographic history of the brackish water phenotypes and go on to discuss the implications of our findings for management of brackish water perch in the western Baltic sea.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGBS data from 12 perch populations, six with brackish and six with freshwater origin\nC_LIO_LIColonisation history and differentiated gene flow shaped the current population structure\nC_LIO_LIThe brackish water ecotype was found in all three major genetic clades\nC_LIO_LITop three regions under selection harboured salinity tolerance genes\nC_LIO_LISalinity influenced Ne during the formation of the Baltic Sea\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516742v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfd04corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@745997org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a5e889org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@459fa2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex mediates sister chromatid cohesion and facilitates mitotic chromosome condensation, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. These biological functions require cohesins two ATPases, formed by the Smc1p and Smc3p subunits. Cohesins ATPase activity is stimulated by the Scc2p auxiliary factor. This stimulation is inhibited by Eco1p acetylation of Smc3p at an interface with Scc2p. It was unclear how cohesins ATPase activity is stimulated by Scc2p, or how acetylation inhibits Scc2p, given that the acetylation site is distal to cohesins ATPase active sites. Here, we identify mutations in budding yeast that suppressed the in vivo defects caused by Smc3p acetyl-mimic and acetyl-defective mutations. We provide compelling evidence that Scc2p activation of cohesin ATPase depends upon an interface between Scc2p and a region of Smc1p proximal to cohesins Smc3p ATPase active site. Furthermore, substitutions at this interface increase or decrease ATPase activity to overcome ATPase modulation by acetyl-mimic and - null mutations. Using these observations and a cryo-EM structure, we propose a model for regulating cohesin ATPase activity. We suggest that Scc2p binding to Smc1p causes a shift in adjacent Smc1p residues and ATP, stimulating the Smc3p ATPase. This stimulatory shift is inhibited through acetylation of the distal Scc2p-Smc3 interface."

The method involves an initial step where the gene of interest is split in silico into small synthons of up to 80 base pairs flanked by Golden Gate-compatible four-base pair overhangs. Synthons are enzymatically synthesized by oligo extension and then assembled into the synthetic gene by Golden Gate Assembly. We construct eight different synthetic genes ranging from 133 to 456 base pairs encoding RNA structures with repetitive elements that are challenging to synthesize. We report assembly fidelities of up to 87.5 % that decrease for increasing number of synthons. This method is envisioned as an important addition to the molecular cloning toolbox and especially useful for construction of challenging and repetitive genes."

Here, we present a precise kcat prediction model (PreKcat) leveraging pretrained language models and a weight redistribution strategy. PreKcat significantly outperforms the previous kcat prediction method in terms of various evaluation metrics. We also confirmed the ability of PreKcat to discriminate enzymes of different metabolic contexts and different types. Additionally, the proposed weight redistribution strategies effectively reduce the prediction error of high kcat values and capture minor effects of amino acid substitutions on two crucial enzymes of the naringenin synthetic pathway, leading to obvious distinctions. Overall, the presented kcat prediction model provides a valuable tool for deciphering the mechanisms of enzyme kinetics and enables novel insights into enzymology and biomedical applications."

Herein, we identified two nuanced isoforms  and {beta} of Keap1, arising from its first and another in-frame translation starting codons, respectively. Those common and specific genes monitored by Keap1 and/or Keap1{beta} were unravelled by transcriptomic sequencing of indicated experimental cell lines. Amongst them, an unusual interaction of Keap1 with Smad2/3 was discovered by parsing transcriptome sequencing, protein profiling, and immunoprecipitation data. Further examinations validated that Smad2/3 enable physical interaction with Keap1, as well as its isoforms  and {beta}, by both EDGETSD and DLG motifs in the linker regions between their MH1 and MH2 domains, such that the stability of Smad2/3 and its transcriptional activity are enhanced with the prolonged half-lives and signalling responsiveness from the cytoplasmic to nuclear compartments. Such activation of Smad2/3 by Keap1, Keap1 or Keap1{beta} was contributable to a competitively inhibitory effect of Nrf2. Overall, this discovery presents a novel functional bridge crossing the Keap1-Nrf2 and the TGF-{beta}1-Smad2/3 signalling pathways in healthy growth and development."

However, the molecular tools available for use in this organism continue to be limiting. In view of this, the CRISPR-Cas tools provide a large repertoire of applications for gene manipulation. We show the utility of the type I-E Cascade system for knocking down gene expression in this organism. A single-vector system was designed for expression of the Cascade components as well as the crRNA. The type I-E Cascade system was better tolerated than the type II-A Cas9 system in D. radiodurans. An assayable acid phosphatase gene, phoN integrated into the genome of this organism could be knocked down to 10% of its activity using the Cascade system. Cascade-based knockdown of ssb, a gene important for radiation resistance resulted in poor recovery post irradiation. Targeting the Radiation and Desiccation Resistance Motif (RDRM), upstream of the ssb, prevented de-repression of its expression upon radiation exposure. In addition to this, multi-locus targeting was demonstrated on the deinococcal genome, by knocking down both phoN and ssb expression simultaneously. The programmable CRISPRi tool developed in this study will facilitate study of essential genes, hypothetical genes, cis-elements involved in radiation response as well as enable metabolic engineering in this organism. Further the tool is amenable for implementing high-throughput approaches for such studies."

    "abstract": "Class 1 cytokine receptors transmit signals through the membrane by a single transmembrane helix to an intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic domain that lacks kinase activity. While specific binding to phosphoinositides has been reported for the prolactin receptor (PRLR), the role of lipids in PRLR signalling is unclear. Using an integrative approach combining NMR spectroscopy, cellular signalling experiments, computational modelling and simulation, we demonstrate co-structure formation of the disordered intracellular domain of the human PRLR, the membrane constituent phosphoinositide-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and the FERM-SH2 domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). We find that the complex leads to accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 at the transmembrane helix interface and that mutation of residues identified to interact specifically with PI(4,5)P2 negatively affects PRLR-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Facilitated by co-structure formation, the membrane-proximal disordered region arranges into an extended structure. We suggest that the co-structure formed between PRLR, JAK2 and PI(4,5)P2 locks the juxtamembrane disordered domain of the PRLR in an extended structure, enabling signal relay from the extracellular to the intracellular domain upon ligand binding. The co-structure exists in different states which could be relevant for turning signalling on and off. Similar co-structures may be relevant for other non-tyrosine kinase receptors."

Metagenomics can be used as a tool to explore the interactions between microbes. Metagenomic assemblies built using long read nanopore data depend on the read level accuracy. The read level accuracy of nanopore sequencing has made dramatic improvements over the past several years. However, we do not know if the increased read level accuracy allows for faster assemblers to make as accurate metagenomic assemblies as slower assemblers. Here, we present the results of a benchmarking study comparing three commonly used long read assemblers, Flye, Raven, and Redbean. We used a prepared DNA standard of seven bacteria as our input community. We prepared a sequencing library on the VolTRAX V2 sequence using a MinION mk1b. We basecalled using the latest version of Guppy with the super-accuracy model. We found that increasing read depth benefited each of the assemblers, and nearly complete community member chromosomes were assembled with as little as 10x read depth. Polishing assemblies using Medaka had a predictable improvement in quality. Some assemblers struggled with particular members of the bacterial community, but we found Flye to be the most robust across taxa. We found Flye was the most effective assembler for recovering plasmids. Based on Flyes consistency for chromosomes and increased effectiveness at assembling plasmids, we would recommend using Flye in future metagenomic studies."

Costimulatory receptors are cell surface proteins on T cells, which are engaged by costimulatory ligands on antigen-presenting cells. Both costimulation and antigen binding are required to trigger T cell activation. In order to study the different pathways activated by these costimulatory risk molecules, and the role they may play in inflammatory disease genetics, we carried out gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) profiling of naive and memory CD4+ T cells (N=5 donors) activated via four different costimulatory receptors: CD28 (the standard molecule used for in vitro activation studies), along with alternative costimulatory molecules ICOS, CD6, and CD27.\n\nMost, but not all, activation genes and regions are shared by different costimulation conditions. Alternative costimulation induced lower proliferation and cytokine production, but higher lysosome production, altered metabolic processing, and indications of \"signal seeking\" behaviour (homing and expression of costimulatory and cytokine receptors).\n\nWe validated a number of these functions at the surface protein level using orthogonal experimental techniques. We found the strongest enrichment of heritability for inflammatory bowel disease in shared regions upregulated by all costimulatory molecules. However, some risk variants and genes were only induced by alternative costimulation, and the impact of these variants on expression were less often successfully mapped in studies of T cells activated by traditional CD28 costimulation. This suggests that future genetics studies of gene expression in activated T cells may benefit from including alternative costimulation conditions."

A strategy that enables targeted degradation of phospho-14-3-3-binding-motif embedded (P-14-3-3-BME) proteins for studying their functions is highly desirable for basic research. Here, we report a phosphorylation-induced, ubiquitin-proteasome-system-mediated targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategy that allows specific degradation of P-14-3-3-BME proteins. Specifically, by ligating a modified von Hippel-Lindau E3-ligase with an engineered 14-3-3 bait, we generated a protein chimera referred to as Targeted Degradation of P-14-3-3-BME Protein (TDPP). TDPP can serve as a universal degrader for P-14-3-3-BME proteins based on the specific recognition of the phosphorylation in 14-3-3 binding motifs. TDPP shows high efficiency and specificity to a difopein-EGFP reporter, general and specific P-14-3-3-BME proteins. TDPP can also be applied for the validation of P-14-3-3-BME proteins. These results strongly support TDPP as a powerful tool for 14-3-3 related research."

    "abstract": "Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 1 and 2 (LRRK1 and LRRK2) are homologs in the ROCO family of proteins in humans. Despite their shared domain architecture and involvement in intracellular trafficking, their disease associations are strikingly different: LRRK2 is involved in familial Parkinsons Disease (PD) while LRRK1 is linked to bone diseases. Furthermore, PD-linked mutations in LRRK2 are typically autosomal dominant gain-of-function while those in LRRK1 are autosomal recessive loss-of-function. To understand these differences, we solved cryo-EM structures of LRRK1 in its monomeric and dimeric forms. Both differ from the corresponding LRRK2 structures. Unlike LRRK2, which is sterically autoinhibited as a monomer, LRRK1 is sterically autoinhibited in a dimer-dependent manner. LRRK1 has an additional level of autoinhibition that prevents activation of the kinase and is absent in LRRK2. Finally, we place the structural signatures of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in the context of the evolution of the LRRK family of proteins."

A critical hallmark of COVID-19 is the occurrence of coagulopathies. Here, we report the direct observation of the interactions between S protein and platelets. Live imaging showed that the S protein triggers platelets to deform dynamically, in some cases, leading to their irreversible activation. Strikingly, cellular cryo-electron tomography revealed dense decorations of S protein on the platelet surface, inducing filopodia formation. Hypothesizing that S protein binds to filopodia-inducing integrin receptors, we tested the binding to RGD motif-recognizing platelet integrins and found that S protein recognizes integrin v{beta}3. Our results infer that the stochastic activation of platelets is due to weak interactions of S protein with integrin, which can attribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the occurrence of rare but severe coagulopathies."

Here, we use a cell type-specific proteomic approach to generate a 21-cell type, 10-tissue map of exercise-regulated secretomes in mice. Our dataset identifies >200 exercise-regulated cell type-secreted protein pairs, the majority of which have not been previously reported. Pdgfra-cre-labeled secretomes were the most responsive to exercise training. Elevated lactate levels can directly regulate protein secretion. Lastly, we establish an anti-obesity and anti-diabetic role for a proteoform of an intracellular carboxylesterase whose secretion from the liver is induced by exercise training. Together, our data uncover the dynamic remodeling of cell and tissue crosstalk by physical activity."

    "date": "2022-12-02",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Ageing is a common feature of living organisms, showing shared molecular features called hallmarks of ageing. Usually they are quantified in groups of individuals as a function of their chronological age (time passed since birth) and display continuous and progressive changes. Such approaches are based on the assumption that individuals taken at a given chronological age are biological replicates. However, even in genetically homogeneous and synchronised populations individuals do die at different chronological ages. This highlights the difference between chronological age and biological age, the latter being defined by the actual mortality risk of the organism, reflecting its physiology. The Smurf assay, previously described by Rera and colleagues, allows the identification of individuals at higher risk of death from natural causes amongst a population of a given chronological age. We found that the categorization of individuals as Smurf or non-Smurf, permits to distinguish transcriptional changes associated with either chronological or biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age, while four out of the six currently defined transcriptional hallmarks of ageing are associated with the biological age of individuals, i.e. their Smurf state. In conclusion, we demonstrate that studying properties of ageing by applying the Smurf classification allows us to differentiate the effect of time from the effect of a physiological response triggering an end-of-life switch (i.e. Smurf phase). More specifically, we show that the ability to isolate a pre-death phase of life in vivo enables us not only to study late life mechanisms preceding death, but also investigate early physiological changes triggering such phase. This allowed the identification of novel pro-longevity genetic interventions.\n\nWe anticipate that the use of the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype in ageing studies will allow significant advances in our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of ageing.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517330v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@262b64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eae17forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a80cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ed351_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG The two-phase model of ageing allows to study separately the effect of chronological and physiological age.\n\n(A) Classic approaches for studying ageing tend to consider it as a black box affecting all individuals progressively from birth to death. Instead, the Smurf phenotype shows that life can be divided into two consecutive phases separated by an abrupt transition. (B) All individuals undergo this transition at a different moment in their life, prior to death. This allows us to switch from population based approaches, comparing bulks of age-matched individuals through time, to individuals-centred approaches relying on direct access to their transition status. (C) Such paradigm shift shows that hallmarks of ageing long thought to progressively change with age are actually mostly affected in a growing proportion of Smurfs, allowing for the identification of the chain of events accompanying ageing and death from natural causes. (D) By studying the behaviour of the ageing transcriptome as a function of chronological age and Smurfness separately, we demonstrate that the progressively changing transcriptional ageing signature, as described in Frenk & Houseley (2018), is in fact the convolution changes accompanying chronological age signature (increased transcriptional noise) and changes associated with Smurfness (or biological age) signature (increased stress response and inflammation, decreased expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes). We also identified a hallmark partially associated with only old Smurfs (ATH5), suggesting that chronological age can affect, late in life, the Smurf response.\n\nC_FIG"

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, but can also promote cancer metastasis. To migrate collectively, cells need to coordinate their protrusion formation, rear retraction, adhesion sites dynamics, as well as forces generation and transmission. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms coordinating these processes remain elusive. Using the A431 carcinoma cell line, we identify the kinase MAP4K4 as a central regulator of collective migration. We show that MAP4K4 inactivation blocks the migration of clusters while its overexpression decreases cluster cohesion. MAP4K4 regulates protrusion and retraction dynamics, remodels the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and controls the stability of both cell-cell and cell substrate adhesion. MAP4K4 promotes focal adhesion disassembly through the phosphorylation of Moesin, an actin and plasma membrane cross-linker, but disassembles adherens junctions through a Moesin-independent mechanism. By analyzing traction and intercellular forces, we found that the stabilization of adhesion sites in MAP4K4 loss of function leads to a tensional disequilibrium throughout the cell cluster, increasing the traction forces exerted onto the substrate and the tension loading at the cell-cell adhesions. Together, our results indicates that MAP4K4 activity is a key regulator of biomechanical forces at adhesion sites, promoting collective migration."

E-Cadherin mutants have been shown to have multiple defects in oogenesis. Therefore, it is difficult to determine E-Cadherin function on germline-soma interaction. In this study, we characterize E-Cadherin function, specifically focusing on germline-soma interaction. Unexpectedly, knockdown of E-Cadherin either in the germline or follicle cells results in excess formation of membrane protrusions at the interface of these cells, which leads to a cell-cell fusion and indicates that homophilic interaction of E-Cadherin is required for maintenance of the tissue boundary between these two adjacent tissues. The fate of follicle cells fused to the germline becomes compromised, leading to a defective individualization of germline cysts. We propose that homophilic interaction of E-Cadherin facilitates a barrier between adjacent tissues, demonstrating a unique model of cell-fate disturbance caused by cell-cell fusion."

    "abstract": "The Golgi is a membrane-bound organelle that is essential for protein and lipid biosynthesis. It represents a central trafficking hub that sorts proteins and lipids to various destinations or for secretion from the cell. The Golgi has emerged as a docking platform for cellular signalling pathways including LRRK2 kinase whose deregulation leads to Parkinson disease. Golgi dysfunction is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. To allow the study of the Golgi at high resolution, we report a rapid immunoprecipitation technique (Golgi-IP) to isolate intact Golgi mini-stacks for subsequent analysis of their content. By fusing the Golgi resident protein TMEM115 to three tandem HA epitopes (GolgiTAG), we purified the Golgi using Golgi-IP with minimal contamination from other compartments. We then established an analysis pipeline using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to characterize the human Golgi proteome, metabolome and lipidome. Subcellular proteomics confirmed known Golgi proteins and identified novel ones. Metabolite profiling established the first known human Golgi metabolome and revealed the selective enrichment of uridine-diphosphate (UDP) sugars and their derivatives, which is consistent with their roles in protein and lipid glycosylation. Furthermore, targeted metabolomics validated SLC35A2 as the subcellular transporter for UDP-hexose. Finally, lipidomics analysis showed that phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine are the most abundant Golgi lipids and that glycosphingolipids are enriched in this compartment. Altogether, our work establishes a comprehensive molecular map of the human Golgi and provides a powerful method to study the Golgi with high precision in health and disease states.\n\nSignificanceThe Golgi is central to protein and lipid processing. It senses and responds to diverse cell states to allow trafficking of macromolecules based on cellular demands. Traditional techniques for purifying the Golgi shaped our understanding of its functions, however such methods are too slow to preserve the labile Golgi metabolome and transient protein interactions. Here, we overcome this issue through the development of a method for the rapid capture of intact Golgi from human cells using organelle-specific immunoprecipitation (Golgi-IP). Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that our approach allows the unbiased characterization of the Golgi proteome, metabolome and lipidome. Thus, we believe that the Golgi-IP will be useful for the study of the Golgi in health and disease states."

Multiple phenotypes can share their genetic component; therefore, modeling these phenotypes jointly may improve prediction accuracy by leveraging effects that are shared across phenotypes. However, effects can be shared across phenotypes in a variety of ways, so computationally efficient statistical methods are needed that can accurately and flexibly capture patterns of effect sharing. Here, we describe new Bayesian multivariate, multiple regression methods that, by using flexible priors, are able to model and adapt to different patterns of effect sharing and specificity across phenotypes. Simulation results show that these new methods are fast and improve prediction accuracy compared with existing methods in a wide range of settings where effects are shared. Further, in settings where effects are not shared our methods still perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods. In real data analyses of expression data in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project our methods improve prediction performance on average for all tissues, with the greatest gains in tissues where effects are strongly shared, and in the tissues with smaller sample sizes. While we use gene expression prediction to illustrate our methods, the methods are generally applicable to any multi-phenotype applications, including prediction of polygenic scores and breeding values. Thus, our methods have the potential to provide improvements across fields and organisms.\n\nAuthor summaryPredicting phenotypes from genotypes is a fundamental problem in quantitative genetics. Thanks to recent advances, it is increasingly feasible to collect data on many phenotypes and genome-wide genotypes in large samples. Here, we tackle the problem of predicting multiple phenotypes from genotypes using a new method based on a multivariate, multiple linear regression model. Although the use of a multivariate, multiple linear regression model is not new, in this paper we introduce a flexible and computationally efficient empirical Bayes approach based on this model. This approach uses a prior that captures how the effects of genotypes on phenotypes are shared across the different phenotypes, and then the prior is adapted to the data in order to capture the most prominent sharing patterns present in the data. We assess the benefits of this flexible Bayesian approach in simulated genetic data sets, and we illustrate its application in predicting gene expression measured in multiple human tissues. We show that our methods can outperform competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy, and the computational effort involved in fitting the model and making the predictions scales well to large data sets."

    "abstract": "Association fine-mapping of molecular traits is an essential method for understanding the impact of genetic variation. Sequencing-based assays, including RNA-seq, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq, have been widely used to measure different cellular traits and enabled genome-wide mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The disruption of cis-regulatory sequence, often occurring through variation within transcription factor binding motifs, has been strongly associated with gene dysregulation and human disease. We recently developed a computational method, TRACE, for transcription factor binding footprint prediction. TRACE integrates chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding motifs to produce quantitative scores that describe the binding affinity of a TF for a specific TFBS locus. Here we have extended this method to incorporate variant data for 57 Yoruban individuals. Using genome-wide chromatin-accessibility data and human TF binding motifs, we have generated precise, genome-wide predictions of individual-specific transcription factor binding footprints. Subsequent association mapping between these footprints and nearby regulatory variants yielded numerous footprint-variant pairs with significant evidence for correlation, which we call footprint-QTLs (fpQTLs). fpQTLs appear to affect TF binding in a distance-dependent manner and share significant overlap with known dsQTLs and eQTLs. fpQTLs provide a rich resource for the study of regulatory variants, both within and outside known TFBSs, leading to improved functional interpretation of noncoding variation."

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that the nuclear import receptor Importin-9 wraps around the H2A-H2B core to chaperone and transport it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Padavannil et al. 2019). However, unlike most nuclear import systems where RanGTP dissociates cargoes from their importins, RanGTP binds stably to the Importin-9*H2A-H2B complex and formation of RanGTP*Importin-9*H2A-H2B facilitates H2A-H2B release to the assembling nucleosome (Padavannil et al. 2019). Here we show cryo-EM structures of Importin-9*RanGTP and of its yeast homolog Kap114, including Kap114*RanGTP, Kap114*H2A-H2B, and RanGTP*Kap114*H2A{-} H2B. In combination with hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis of Importin-9 complexes and nucleosome assembly assays, we explain how the conserved Kap114/Importin-9 importins bind H2A-H2B and RanGTP simultaneously and how the GTPase primes histone transfer to the nucleosome. We show that RanGTP binds to the N-terminal repeats of Kap114/Importin-9 as in Kap114/Importin-9*RanGTP, and H2A-H2B binds via its acidic patch to the Kap114/Importin-9 C{-} terminal repeats as in Kap114/Importin-9*H2A-H2B. RanGTP-binding in RanGTP*Kap114*H2A{-} H2B changes Kap114/Importin-9 conformation such that it no longer contacts the surface of H2A{-} H2B proximal to the H2A docking domain that drives nucleosome assembly, positioning it for transfer to the assembling nucleosome. The reduced affinity of RanGTP for Kap114/Importin-9 when H2A-H2B is bound may ensure release of H2A-H2B only at chromatin."

    "abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway is a cell-cell communication system with fundamental roles in embryonic development and the nervous system. The model of Notch receptor activation that is currently most accepted, involves a force-induced conformation change at the negative regulatory region of the receptor, the subsequent recruitment of ADAM metalloproteases and a cleavage cascade that releases the Notch intracellular domain. Here, we define conditions that enable force-independent Notch activation through the formation of soluble, long-lived, multivalent ligand-receptor complexes. To investigate how ligand valency affects activation of Notch receptors, we treated iPSc-derived neuroepithelial stem-like (lt-NES) cells with different spatially defined, molecularly precise ligand nanopatterns on DNA origami nanostructures. Our data indicate that Notch signaling is activated via stimulation with multivalent clusters of the ligand Jag1, and even multivalent chimeric structures where some Jag1 proteins are replaced by other binders that do not target Notch. The findings are corroborated by systematic elimination, through experimental control, of several confounding factors that potentially could generate forces, including electrostatic interactions, endocytosis and non-specific binding. Taken together, our data suggest a model where Jag1 ligands are able to activate Notch receptors upon prolonged binding, which subsequently triggers downstream signaling in a force independent manner. These findings reveal a distinct mode of activation of Notch and could lay the foundation for the development of soluble Notch agonists that currently remain elusive."

    "abstract": "Bacterial gene expression is highly regulated to allow cells to grow and adapt. Much regulation occurs during transcription elongation, where RNA polymerase (RNAP) extends nascent RNA transcripts aided by global and universally-conserved elongation factor NusG. NusG modulates transcription by inhibiting pausing and backtracking; promoting anti-termination on ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons; coupling transcription with translation on mRNA genes; and stimulating Rho-dependent termination on toxic genes. Despite extensive work on NusG, its functional allocation and spatial distribution in vivo is unknown. Here, we addressed these long-standing questions using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging of NusG in live E. coli cells. We found that, under conditions of moderate growth, NusG is mainly present as a population that associates indirectly with the chromosome via RNAP in transcription elongation complexes, and a slowly diffusing population we identified as a NusG complex with the 30S ribosomal subunit; this complex offers a \"30S-guided\" path for NusG to enter transcription elongation. Only ~10% of total NusG was fast-diffusing, with the mobility of this population suggesting that free NusG interacts non-specifically with DNA for >50% of the time. Using antibiotics and deletion mutants, we showed that most chromosome-associated NusG is involved in rrn anti-termination and in transcriptiontranslation coupling. NusG involvement in rrn anti-termination was mediated via its participation in phase-separated transcriptional condensates. Our work illuminates the diverse activities of a central regulator while offering a guide on how to dissect the roles of multi-functional machines using in vivo imaging."

However, a general screening strategy applicable to all proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids is still lacking. Modification of the critical structure of tRNA could decrease the aminoacylation level of tRNA catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Involved in a two-substrate sequential reaction, amino acids with increased concentration could elevate the reduced aminoacylation rate caused by specific tRNA modification. Here, we developed a selection system for overproducers of specific amino acids using corresponding engineered tRNAs and reporter genes. As a proof-of-concept, overproducers of five amino acids such as L-tryptophan were screened out by growth-based and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening from random mutation libraries of Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. This study provided a universal strategy that could be applied to screen overproducers of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids in amber-stop-codon-recoded or non-recoded hosts."

However, RRM-containing proteins are only prevalent in eukaryotic phyla, in which they play central regulatory roles. Here, we engineered an orthogonal post-transcriptional control system of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli with the mammalian RNA-binding protein Musashi-1, which is a stem cell marker with neurodevelopmental role that contains two canonical RRMs. In the circuit, Musashi-1 is regulated transcriptionally and works as an allosteric translation repressor thanks to a specific interaction with the leader coding region of a messenger RNA and its structural plasticity to respond to fatty acids. We fully characterized the genetic system at the population and single-cell levels showing a significant fold change in reporter expression, and the underlying molecular mechanism by assessing the in vitro binding kinetics and in vivo functionality of a series of RNA mutants. Moreover, the dynamic response of the system was well recapitulated by a bottom-up mathematical model. This work illustrates how RRM-based regulation can be adapted to simple organisms, thereby paving the way for engineering more complex circuits in prokaryotes by combining transcription and translation control with proteins."

Interestingly, this new vector design displayed the same performance as pSEVA231 in Escherichia coli DH10B.

    "abstract": "High-throughput genotyping facilitates the large-scale analysis of genetic diversity in population genomics and genome-wide association studies that combine the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of large collections of wild and domesticated germplasm. Genotyping by sequencing is progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping by sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% of which consists of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (unique regions). We designed a custom set of 566,722 gRNAs, each with at least 25 recognition sites, targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats in 500-bp insert sequencing libraries. We excluded repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed 40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to unique and functional regions by 2.6-fold. This repeat-to-unique shift in the sequencing data increased the number of genotyped bases by up to 17-fold compared to non-depleted libraries. We were also able to identify up to 18-fold more genetic variants in the unique regions and increased the genotyping accuracy by rescuing thousands of heterozygous variants that otherwise would be missed due to low coverage. The method performed similarly regardless of the multiplexing level, type of library or genotypes, including different cultivars and a closely-related species (L. orientalis). Our results confirmed that CRISPR/Cas9-driven repeat depletion focuses sequencing data on meaningful genomic regions, helping to improve high-density and genome-wide genotyping in large and repetitive genomes."

This small genome is crucial for proper functioning of mitochondria, the energy-converting organelles. In mammals, mtDNA is arranged into macromolecular complexes called nucleoids that serve as functional stations for its maintenance and expression. Here, we aimed to explore an uncharacterized protein c17orf80, which was previously detected close to the nucleoid components by proximity-labelling mass spectrometry. To investigate the subcellular localization and function of c17orf80, we took an advantage of immunofluorescence microscopy, interaction proteomics and several biochemical assays. We demonstrate that c17orf80 is a mitochondrial membrane-associated protein that interacts with nucleoids even when mtDNA replication is inhibited. In addition, we show that c17orf80 is not essential for mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial gene expression in cultured human cells. These results provide a basis for uncovering the molecular function of c17orf80 and the nature of its association with nucleoids, possibly leading to new insights about mtDNA and its expression."

    "abstract": "Drug combination therapy is a promising solution to many complicated diseases. Since experimental measurements cannot be scaled to millions of candidate combinations, many computational approaches have been developed to identify synergistic drug combinations. While most of the existing approaches either use SMILES-based features or molecular-graph-based features to represent drugs, we found that neither of these two feature modalities can comprehensively characterize a pair of drugs, necessitating the integration of these two types of features. Here, we propose Pisces, a cross-modal contrastive learning approach for synergistic drug combination prediction. The key idea of our approach is to model the combination of SMILES and molecular graphs as four views of a pair of drugs, and then apply contrastive learning to embed these four views closely to obtain high-quality drug pair embeddings. We evaluated Pisces on a recently released GDSC-Combo dataset, including 102,893 drug combinations and 125 cell lines. Pisces outperformed five existing drug combination prediction approaches under three settings, including vanilla cross validation, stratified cross validation for drug combinations, and stratified cross validation for cell lines. Our case study and ablation studies further confirmed the effectiveness of our novel contrastive learning framework and the importance of integrating the SMILES-based features and the molecular-graph-based features. Pisces has obtained the state-of-the-art results on drug synergy prediction and can be potentially used to model other pairs of drugs applications, such as drug-drug interaction.\n\nAvailabilityImplementation of Pisces and comparison approaches can be accessed at https://github.com/linjc16/Pisces."

Mating-type is switched by Rad51-driven gene conversion of mat1 using a heterochromatic donor cassette, mat2-P or mat3-M. The Swi2-Swi5 complex, a mating-type switching factor, is central to this process by designating a preferred donor in a cell-type-specific manner. Swi2-Swi5 selectively enables one of two cisacting recombination enhancers, SRE2 adjacent to mat2-P or SRE3 adjacent to mat3-M. Here, we identified two functionally important motifs in Swi2, a Swi6 (HP1 homolog)-binding site and two DNA-binding AT-hooks. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the AT-hooks were required for Swi2 localization at SRE3 to select the mat3-M donor in P cells, while the Swi6-binding site was required for Swi2 localization at SRE2 to select mat2-P in M cells. In addition, the Swi2-Swi5 complex promoted Rad51-driven strand exchange in vitro. Taken together, our results show how the Swi2-Swi5 complex would localize to recombination enhancers through a cell-type specific binding mechanism and stimulate Rad51-driven gene conversion at the localization site."

However, it is still unclear how the brain achieve efficient use of energy. Here, using nerve cells as test subjects, we found that THz photons with a specific frequency can effectively restore the reduced frequency of action potentials caused by inadequate adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) supply, which has been demonstrated as a novel mode of energy supply, present photons emission at a particular frequency from the breaking of the ATP phosphate bond. This energy supply mechanism may play a key biophysical basis for explaining how the body efficiently obtain energy, because the quantized chemical reactions could have a high energy efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity compared with the traditional thermochemistry and photochemistry."

In particular, the dynamics of structural changes and observed indicators of the mechanistically important coherent oscillations of the Fe-CO bond distance (predicted by recent quantum wavepacket dynamics15) are seen to depend strongly on pump laser energy. Our results confirm both the feasibility and necessity of performing TR-SFX pump probe experiments in the linear photoexcitation regime. We consider this to be a starting point for reassessing design and interpretation of ultrafast TR-SFX pump probe experiments16 such that biologically relevant insight emerges."

    "abstract": "The mammalian plasma membrane regulates cellular interactions with the extracellular environment through a dense assembly of membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. Although the spatial organization of the cell surface glycocalyx is critical for mediating the binding of ligands, receptors, and macromolecules on the plasma membrane, we currently do not have the methods to quantify the spatial hetero-geneities on live cell surfaces. In this work, we engineer molecular antigen sensors that act as a direct reporter of live cell surface crowding heterogeneities with nanometer spatial resolution. By quantifying the effective binding affinity of IgG monoclonal antibodies to our antigen sensors on reconstituted and live cells, we provide a biophysical understanding of the molecular-to-mesoscale spatial organization of the glycocalyx. We find that the antigen location strongly influences the IgG binding on the red blood cell membrane, with the strongest gradients occurring within a few nanometers of the membrane. We develop an analytical theory and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to corroborate our results, and combine surface proteomics with our simulations and theory for an in-silico reconstruction of the red blood cell surface. We also show that the effective binding affinity above raft-like domains is much higher than that of the bulk membrane on human cancer cells, suggesting that raft-like domains exclude membrane proteins with bulky extracellular domains. Our facile and high-throughput method to quantify spatial crowding heterogeneities on live cell membranes may facilitate monoclonal antibody design and provide a mechanistic understanding of plasma membrane biophysical organization.\n\nSignificance StatementThe mammalian cell surface is decorated with a protective \"shield\" of membrane proteins and sugars that enables cells to mediate interactions with the extracellular environment. The precise spatial distribution of the proteins and sugars are critical for cell function, but we currently do not have the techniques to quantify the spatial heterogeneities on the cell membrane surface. In this work, we develop a method to quantify the spatial organization of the cell surface by engineering molecular antigen sensors that act as a direct reporter of local macro-molecular crowding."

    "abstract": "O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an emerging post-translation modification that couples metabolism with cellular signal transduction by crosstalking with phosphorylation and ubiquitination to orchestrate various biological processes. Herein we show that it modifies the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-mRNA reader YTHDF1 and fine-tunes its nuclear translocation by the exportin protein Crm1. First we present evidence that YTHDF1 interacts with the sole O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Second, we verified the YTHDF1 O-GlcNAcylation sites to be Ser196/Ser197/Ser198, as described in previous numerous chemoproteomic studies. Then we constructed the O-GlcNAc-deficient YTHDF1-S196AS197FS198A (AFA) mutants, which significantly attentuated O-GlcNAc signals. Moreover, we revealed that YTHDF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, whose nuclear export is mediated by Crm1. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation increases the cytosolic portion of YTHDF1 by enhancing binding with Crm1, thus upregulating the downstream target (e.g. c-Myc) expression. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that O-GlcNAcylation at S197 might promote the binding between the nuclear export signal motif and Crm1 through increasing hydrogen bonding. Mouse xenograft assays further demonstrate that YTHDF1-AFA mutants decreased the colon cancer mass and size via decreasing c-Myc expression. In sum, we found that YTHDF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, whose cytosolic localization is dependent on O-GlcNAc modification. We propose that the OGT-YTHDF1-c-Myc axis might underlie colorectal cancer tumorigenesis."

Here we assess the accuracy of AlphaFold predictions by comparing them to density maps obtained from automated redeterminations of recent crystal structures and to the corresponding deposited models. Some AlphaFold predictions match experimental maps closely, but most differ on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. Such differences occur even in parts of AlphaFold models that were predicted with high confidence. Generally, the dissimilarities exceed those between high-resolution pairs of structures containing the same components but determined in different space groups. Therefore, while AlphaFold predictions are useful hypotheses about protein structures, experimental information remains essential for creating an accurate model.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAlphaFold predictions can be very accurate but should be treated as hypotheses as even high-confidence parts can be inconsistent with experimental data."

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease is characterised by CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats, resulting in polyglutamine expansion of the huntingtin protein (HTT). The biological role of wildtype HTT and the associated mechanisms of disease pathology caused by expanded HTT remain incompletely understood, in part, due to challenges characterising interactions between HTT and putative binding partners. Here we describe a biochemical toolkit of rationally designed, high-quality recombinant HTT subdomains; one spanning the N-terminal HEAT and bridge domains (NTD) and the second spanning the C-terminal HEAT domain (CTD). Using biophysical methods and cryo-electron microscopy, we show these smaller subdomains are natively folded and can associate to reconstitute a functional full-length HTT structure capable of forming a near native-like complex with 40 kDa HTT-associated protein (HAP40). We report biotin-tagged variants of these subdomains, as well as full-length HTT, that permit immobilisation of each protein for quantitative biophysical assays without impacting protein quality. We demonstrate the CTD alone can form a stable complex when co-expressed with HAP40, which can be structurally resolved. The CTD-HAP40 complex binds the NTD, with a dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM as measured by bio-layer interferometry. We validate the interaction between the CTD and HAP40 using a luciferase two-hybrid assay and use subdomain constructs to demonstrate their respective stabilization of HAP40 in cells. These open-source biochemical tools will enable the wider HD community to study fundamental HTT biology, discover new macromolecular or small-molecule binding partners and map interaction sites across this very large protein."

    "abstract": "Icumazoles are potent antifungal polyketides with intriguing structural features. Here, we present the polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster of icumazoles. Surprisingly, an unusual non-terminal thioesterase domain divides the PKS/NRPS assembly line. The succeeding PKS modules potentially form a rare precursor 4-methyl-2-hexenoyl-ACP thus deviating from the previously proposed polyoxypeptin pathway. The 4-methyl-2-hexenoyl-ACP is further reductive carboxylated to 2-methylbutylmalonyl-ACP essential for icumazole biosynthesis by IcuL, representing a new type of crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR). We characterize IcuL and its homologs TgaD and Leu10 in vitro, suggesting a stricter substrate specificity of this new family of CCRs than found in canonical ones. Intriguingly, we also find that TgaD unprecedently utilizes both NADPH and NADH as cofactors with similar efficiency, diverging from the NADPH-specific characteristic of canonical CCRs. Furthermore, a sequence similarity network-based bioinformatic survey reveals that the IcuL-like CCRs are evolutionarily separated from canonical CCRs."

    "abstract": "Toxicity of accumulating substrates is a significant problem in several disorders of valine and isoleucine degradation notably short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1 or crotonase) deficiency, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) deficiency, propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA). Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD8) and short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD, ACADSB) function in the valine and isoleucine degradation pathways, respectively. Deficiencies of these acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) enzymes are considered biochemical abnormalities with limited or no clinical consequences. We investigated whether substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of ACAD8 and SBCAD can limit the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates in disorders of valine and isoleucine metabolism. Using analysis of acylcarnitine isomers, we show that 2-methylenecyclopropaneacetic acid (MCPA) inhibited SBCAD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, but not ACAD8. MCPA treatment of wild-type and PA HEK-293 cells caused a pronounced decrease in C3-carnitine. Furthermore, deletion of ACADSB in HEK-293 cells led to an equally strong decrease in C3-carnitine when compared to wild-type cells. Deletion of ECHS1 in HEK-293 cells caused a defect in lipoylation of the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was not rescued by ACAD8 deletion. MCPA was able to rescue lipoylation in ECHS1 KO cells, but only in cells with prior ACAD8 deletion. SBCAD was not the sole ACAD responsible for this compensation, which indicates substantial promiscuity of ACADs in HEK-293 cells for the isobutyryl-CoA substrate. Substrate promiscuity appeared less prominent for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA at least in HEK-293 cells. We suggest that pharmacological inhibition of SBCAD to treat PA should be investigated further."

    "abstract": "Humans display vast clinical variability upon SARS-CoV-2 infection1-3, partly due to genetic and immunological factors4. However, the magnitude of population differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms underlying such variation remain unknown. Here we report single-cell RNA-sequencing data for peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 222 healthy donors of various ancestries stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 induces a weaker, but more heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene activity than influenza A virus, and a unique pro-inflammatory signature in myeloid cells. We observe marked population differences in transcriptional responses to viral exposure that reflect environmentally induced cellular heterogeneity, as illustrated by higher rates of cytomegalovirus infection, affecting lymphoid cells, in African-descent individuals. Expression quantitative trait loci and mediation analyses reveal a broad effect of cell proportions on population differences in immune responses, with genetic variants having a narrower but stronger effect on specific loci. Additionally, natural selection has increased immune response differentiation across populations, particularly for variants associated with SARS-CoV-2 responses in East Asians. We document the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which Neanderthal introgression has altered immune functions, such as its impact on the myeloid response in Europeans. Finally, colocalization analyses reveal an overlap between the genetic architecture of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Collectively, these findings suggest that adaptive evolution targeting immunity has also contributed to current disparities in COVID-19 risk."

Here we show that mice deficient for PARL, the mitochondrial rhomboid protease, a recently reported model of Leigh syndrome, develop postpubertal testicular atrophy caused by arrested spermatogenesis and germ cell death independently of neurodegeneration. Genetic modifications of PINK1, PGAM5, and TTC19, three major substrates of PARL with important roles in mitochondrial homeostasis, do not reproduce or modify this phenotype. PARL deficiency in testis mitochondria leads to severe mitochondrial electron transfer chain defects, alterations in Coenzyme Q biosynthesis and redox status, and abrogates GPX4 expression specifically in spermatocytes leading to massive ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. Thus, mitochondrial defects can initiate ferroptosis in vivo in specific cell types by simultaneous effects on GPX4 and Coenzyme Q. These results highlight the importance of ferroptosis and cell-type specific downstream responses to mitochondrial deficits with respect to specific manifestations of mitochondrial diseases."

Accumulating evidence from live-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy of mammalian cells suggests an asymmetric distribution of actin fibers near the clathrin-coated pit, which induces asymmetric pit-closing, rather than radial constriction. However, detailed molecular mechanisms of this \"asymmetricity\" remain elusive. Herein, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that CIP4, a multidomain protein with a classic F-BAR domain and intrinsically disordered regions, is necessary for asymmetric pit-closing. Strong self-assembly of CIP4 via intrinsically disordered regions, together with stereospecific interactions with the curved membrane and actin-regulating proteins, generates a small actin-rich environment near the pit, which deforms the membrane and closes the pit. Our results provide a mechanistic insight into how spatio-temporal actin polymerization near the plasma membrane is promoted by a collaboration of disordered and structured domains."

Representing ECM and cell-ECM interactions is a challenging multi-scale problem that acts across the tissue and cell scales. While several computational frameworks exist for ECM modeling, they typically focus on very detailed modeling of individual ECM fibers or represent only a single aspect of the ECM. Using the PhysiCell agent-based modeling platform, we combine aspects of previous modeling efforts and develop a framework of intermediate detail that addresses direct cell-ECM interactions. We represent a small region of ECM as an ECM element containing 3 variables: anisotropy, density, and orientation. We then place many ECM elements through a space to form an ECM. Cells have a mechanical response to the local ECM variables and remodel ECM based on their velocity. We demonstrate aspects of this framework with a model of cell invasion where the cells motile phenotype is driven by the ECM microstructure patterned by prior cells movements. Investigating the limit of high-speed communication and with stepwise introduction of the framework features, we generate a range of cellular dynamics and ECM patterns - from recapitulating a homeostatic tissue, to indirect communication of paths (stigmergy), to collective migration. When we relax the high-speed communication assumption, we find that the behaviors persist but can be lost as rate of signal generation declines. This result suggests that cell-cell communication mitigated via the ECM can constitute an important mechanism for pattern formation in dynamic cellular patterning while other processes likely also contribute to leader-follower behavior."

    "abstract": "Although plastid genome (plastome) structure is highly conserved across most seed plants, investigations during the past two decades revealed several disparately related lineages that experienced substantial rearrangements. Most plastomes contain a large, inverted repeat and two single-copy regions and few dispersed repeats, however the plastomes of some taxa harbor long repeat sequences (>300 bp). These long repeats make it difficult to assemble complete plastomes using short-read data leading to misassemblies and consensus sequences that have spurious rearrangements. Single-molecule, long-read sequencing has the potential to overcome these challenges, yet there is no consensus on the most effective method for accurately assembling plastomes using long-read data. We generated a pipeline, plastid Genome Assembly Using Long-read data (ptGAUL), to address the problem of plastome assembly using long-read data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or Pacific Biosciences platforms. We demonstrated the efficacy of the ptGAUL pipeline using 16 published long-read datasets. We showed that ptGAUL produces accurate and unbiased assemblies. Additionally, we employed ptGAUL to assemble four new Juncus (Juncaceae) plastomes using ONT long reads. Our results revealed many long repeats and rearrangements in Juncus plastomes compared with basal lineages of Poales."

    "abstract": "Cellular abscission is the final step of cytokinesis that leads to the physical separation of the two daughter cells. The scaffold protein ALIX and the ESCRT-I protein TSG101 contribute to recruiting ESCRT-III to the midbody, which orchestrates the final membrane scission of the intercellular bridge. Here, we addressed by which mechanisms ALIX and the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4B are transported to the midbody. Structured illumination microscopy revealed gradual accumulation of ALIX at the midbody, resulting in the formation of spiral-like structures extending from the midbody to the abscission site, which strongly co-localized with CHMP4B. Live-cell microscopy uncovered that ALIX appeared together with CHMP4B in vesicular structures, whose motility was microtubule-dependent. Depletion of ALIX led to structural alterations of the midbody and delayed recruitment of CHMP4B, resulting in delayed abscission. Likewise, depletion of the kinesin-1 motor KIF5B reduced the motility of ALIX-positive vesicles and caused delayed recruitment of ALIX, TSG101 and CHMP4B to the midbody, accompanied by impeded abscission. We propose that ALIX, TSG101 and CHMP4B are associated with endosomal vesicles transported along microtubules by kinesin-1, leading to their directional transport to the cytokinetic bridge and midbody, thereby contributing to their function in abscission."

    "abstract": "Lamins A/C are nuclear intermediate filament proteins that are involved in diverse cellular mechanical and biochemical functions. Here, we report that recognition of Lamins A/C by a commonly used antibody (JOL-2) that binds the Lamin A/C Ig-fold and other antibodies targeting similar epitopes is highly dependent on cell density, even though Lamin A/C protein levels do not change with cell density. The density-dependent Lamin A/C labeling was distinct from previously reported differential apico-basal labeling, which was independent of cell density. Comparison of the density-dependent labeling effects of antibodies recognizing different Lamin A/C epitopes suggests that the effect is caused by partial unfolding or masking of the CE and/or EF loops of the Ig-fold in response to cell spreading. Seeding cells on micropatterned surfaces with different areas confirmed that increased cell spreading resulted in reduced Lamin A/C labeling with the JOL-2 antibody. Surprisingly, JOL-2 antibody labeling was insensitive to depolymerization of cytoskeletal filaments or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. Although the density-dependent changes of the Ig-fold did not alter nuclear stiffness or nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission, they may nonetheless modulate interaction with lamin binding partners and thereby affect cellular functions. Taken together, our results point to a previously unrecognized change in the Lamin A/C Ig-fold that affects recognition by the JOL-2 antibody. These findings are not only important for the interpretation of immunofluorescence data for Lamin A/C, but also raise the intriguing prospect that the conformational changes may play a role in Lamin A/C mediated cellular function."

    "abstract": "The photoreceptor outer segment is a modified cilium filled with hundreds of flattened \"disc\" membranes responsible for efficient light capture. To maintain photoreceptor health and functionality, outer segments are continuously renewed through the addition of new discs at their base. This process is driven by branched actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex. To induce actin polymerization, Arp2/3 requires a nucleation promoting factor. Here, we show that the nucleation promoting factor driving disc morphogenesis is the pentameric WAVE complex and identify all protein subunits of this complex. We further demonstrate that the knockout of one of them, WASF3, abolishes actin polymerization at the site of disc morphogenesis leading to formation of disorganized membrane lamellae emanating from the photoreceptor cilium instead of an outer segment. These data establish that, despite the intrinsic ability of photoreceptor ciliary membranes to form lamellar structures, WAVE-dependent actin polymerization is essential for organizing these membranes into a proper outer segment."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the inherited autosomal recessive disorders with very complicated pathogenesis. Identifying the molecular signatures and specific biomarkers of CF might provide novel clues for CF and and CF associated complications prognosis and targeted therapy. Based on the nexgeneration sequencing (NGS) dataset GSE136371 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CF samples and normal controls were identified by using DESeq2 bioconductor package of R software. Gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses were applied for the DEGs. Then protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these DEGs was visualized by Cytoscape with IMEx interactome database. The most significant module from the PPI network was selected for GO and pathway enrichment analysis. Subsequently, a miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed to identify hub genes, miRNAs and TFs. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was established to validate these hub genes. Total of 917 DEGs were identified between CF and normal control samples in GSE136371 dataset, including 479 up regulated and 438 down regulated genes. The most enriched DEGs in GO and pathway enrichment analysis were mainly associated with response to stimulus, regulation of cellular process, Neutrophil degranulation and rRNA processing. PPI network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network predicted ten hub genes (FN1, UBE2D1, SRPK1, MAPK14, CEBPB, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, XRCC6, NCL and PARP1). In conclusion, the DEGs, relative pathways and hub genes identified in the present study might aid in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CF and CF associated complications progression and provide potential molecular targets and biomarkers for CF and CF associated complications."

Its implementation, however, lacks the code and data required to train new models. These are necessary to (i) tackle new tasks, like protein-ligand complex structure prediction, (ii) investigate the process by which the model learns, which remains poorly understood, and (iii) assess the models generalization capacity to unseen regions of fold space. Here we report OpenFold, a fast, memory-efficient, and trainable implementation of AlphaFold2, and OpenProtein-Set, the largest public database of protein multiple sequence alignments. We use OpenProteinSet to train OpenFold from scratch, fully matching the accuracy of AlphaFold2. Having established parity, we assess OpenFolds capacity to generalize across fold space by retraining it using carefully designed datasets. We find that OpenFold is remarkably robust at generalizing despite extreme reductions in training set size and diversity, including near-complete elisions of classes of secondary structure elements. By analyzing intermediate structures produced by OpenFold during training, we also gain surprising insights into the manner in which the model learns to fold proteins, discovering that spatial dimensions are learned sequentially. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the power and utility of OpenFold, which we believe will prove to be a crucial new resource for the protein modeling community."

    "abstract": "Multi-site collaboration is essential for overcoming the small-sample problems when exploring reproducible biomarkers in MRI studies. However, various scanner-specific factors dramatically reduce the cross-scanner replicability. Existing harmony methods mostly could not guarantee the improved performance of downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose a new multi-scanner harmony framework, called  maximum classifier discrepancy generative adversarial network, or MCD-GAN, for removing scanner effects while improving performances in the subsequent tasks. The adversarial generative network is utilized for persisting the structural layout of data, and the maximum classifier discrepancy can regulate feature generators by considering the downstream task. The proposed MCD-GAN is compared with other state-of-the-art harmony approaches (e.g., ComBat, CycleGAN) using simulated data and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset. Results demonstrate that MCD-GAN outperforms other approaches in improving cross-scanner classification performance while preserving the anatomical layout of the images. The proposed MCD-GAN, as a promising solution for facilitating cross-site reproducibility in neuroimaging, can be generalized to various classification or regression tasks.

    "date": "2022-11-22",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing is a widely-used high-throughput genome sequencing technology that can sequence long fragments of a genome. Nanopore sequencing generates noisy electrical signals that need to be converted into a standard string of DNA nucleotide bases (i.e., A, C, G, T) using a computational step called basecalling. The accuracy and speed of basecalling have critical implications for every subsequent step in genome analysis. Currently, basecallers are mainly based on deep learning techniques to provide high sequencing accuracy without considering the compute demands of such tools. We observe that state-of-the-art basecallers (i.e., Guppy, Bonito) are slow, inefficient, and memory-hungry as researchers have adapted deep learning models from other domains without specialization to the basecalling purpose. Our goal is to make basecalling highly efficient and fast by building the first framework for specializing and optimizing machine learning-based basecaller. We introduce RUBICON, a framework to develop hardware-optimized basecallers. RUBICON consists of two novel machine-learning techniques that are specifically designed for basecalling. First, we introduce the quantization-aware basecalling neural architecture search (QABAS) framework to specialize the basecalling neural network architecture for a given hardware acceleration platform while jointly exploring and finding the best bit-width precision for each neural network layer. Second, we develop SkipClip, the first technique to remove all the skip connections present in modern basecallers to greatly reduce resource and storage requirements without any loss in basecalling accuracy. We demonstrate the benefits of QABAS and SkipClip by developing RUBICALL, the first hardware-optimized basecaller that performs fast and accurate basecalling. Our experimental results on state-of-the-art computing systems show that RUBICALL is a fast, accurate and hardware-friendly, mixed-precision basecaller. Compared to a highly-accurate state-of-the-art basecaller, RUBICALL provides a 16.56x speedup without losing accuracy, while also achieving a 6.88 x and 2.94x reduction in neural network model size and the number of parameters, respectively. Compared to the fastest state-of-the-art basecaller, RUBICALL provides a 3.19x speedup with 2.97% higher accuracy. We show that QABAS and SkipClip can help researchers develop hardware-optimized basecallers that are superior to expert-designed models."

We characterized the genetic architecture of alternative splicing and compared its basic features with overall gene expression. We detected a large number of novel alternative splicing events that were not previously annotated. We found heritability of quantitative alternative splicing scores (percent spliced in or PSI) to be lower than that of overall gene expression. In addition, heritabilities showed little correlation between alternative splicing and overall gene expression. Finally, we mapped expression QTLs (eQTLs) and splice QTLs (sQTLs) and found them to be largely non-overlapping.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that regulatory variation exists at multiple levels and that their genetic controls are distinct, offering opportunities for genetic improvement."

In this work we use machine learning methods to analyse data from DrugAge, a database of chemical compounds (including drugs) modulating lifespan in model organisms. To this end, we created four datasets for predicting whether or not a compound extends the lifespan of C. elegans (the most frequent model organism in DrugAge), using four different types of predictive biological features, based on compound-protein interactions, interactions between compounds and proteins encoded by ageing-related genes, and two types of terms annotated for proteins targeted by the compounds, namely Gene Ontology (GO) terms and physiology terms from the WormBases Phenotype Ontology. To analyse these datasets we used a combination of feature selection methods in a data pre-processing phase and the well-established random forest algorithm for learning predictive models from the selected features. The two best models were learned using GO terms and protein interactors as features, with predictive accuracies of about 82% and 80%, respectively. In addition, we interpreted the most important features in those two best models in light of the biology of ageing, and we also predicted the most promising novel compounds for extending lifespan from a list of previously unlabelled compounds."

The top VEPs are dominated by unsupervised methods including EVE, DeepSequence and ESM-1v, a new protein language model that ranked first overall. However, the strong performance of recent supervised VEPs, in particular VARITY, shows that developers are taking data circularity and bias issues seriously. We also assess the performance of DMS and unsupervised VEPs for discriminating between known pathogenic and putatively benign missense variants. Our findings are mixed, demonstrating that some DMS datasets perform exceptionally at variant classification, while others are poor. Notably, we observe a striking correlation between VEP agreement with DMS data and performance in identifying clinically relevant variants, with EVE, DeepSequence and ESM-1v performing best, further supporting the utility of DMS as an independent benchmark."

However, scATAC-seq data posed challenges for data analysis because of its near binarization, high sparsity, and ultra-high dimensionality properties. Here we proposed a novel network diffusion-based method to comprehensively analyze scATAC-seq data, named Single-Cell ATAC-seq Analysis via Network Refinement with Peaks Location Information (SCARP). By modeling the prior probability of co-accessibility between adjacent peaks as a decreasing function of genomic distance, SCARP is the first scATAC-seq analysis method that utilizes the genomic information of peaks, which contributed to characterizing co-accessibility of peaks. SCARP used network to model the accessible relationships between cells and peaks, aggregated information with the diffusion method, and then performed dimensionality reduction to obtain low-dimensional cell embeddings as well as peak embeddings. We have demonstrated through sufficient experiments that SCARP facilitated superior analysis of scATAC-seq data. Specifically, SCARP exhibited outstanding cell clustering performance to better elucidate cell heterogeneity, and can be used to reveal new biologically significant cell subpopulations. SCARP was also instrumental in portraying co-accessibility relationships of accessible regions and providing new insight into transcriptional regulation, and those SCARP-derived genes were involved in some key KEGG pathways related to diseases. To sum up, our studies suggested that SCARP is a promising tool to comprehensively analyze the scATAC-seq data from a new perspective."

However, the mechanisms of mitotic transcriptional inactivation and their interplay with chromosome assembly remain largely unknown. By monitoring ongoing transcription in Drosophila early embryos, we reveal that eviction of nascent mRNAs from mitotic chromatin occurs after substantial chromosome compaction and is not promoted by condensin I. Instead, we show that the timely removal of transcripts from mitotic chromatin is driven by the SNF2 helicase-like protein Lodestar (Lds), identified here as a modulator of sister chromatid cohesion defects. In addition to transcriptional termination, we uncovered that Lds cooperates with Topoisomerase 2 to ensure efficient sister chromatid resolution and mitotic fidelity. We conclude that mitotic transcriptional termination is not a passive consequence of cell cycle progression and/or chromosome compaction but occurs via dedicated mechanisms with functional parallelisms to sister chromatid resolution."

For example, parabiosis and partial reprogramming through overexpressing four stem cell transcription factors (Yamanaka factors) both rejuvenate organisms and cells1-5. We hypothesize there are many other genetic solutions to human cell rejuvenation, and some solutions may be safer and more potent than current gene targets. We set out to develop a systematic approach to identify novel genes that, when overexpressed or repressed, reprogram the global gene expression of a cell back to a younger state. Using the Hayflick model of human cell replicative aging, we performed a Perturb-seq screen of 200 transcription factors (TFs) selected through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and literature search. We identified dozens of potentially rejuvenating TFs--those that when overexpressed or repressed in late passage cells reprogrammed global gene expression patterns back to an earlier passage state. We further validated four top TF perturbations through molecular phenotyping of various aging hallmarks. Late passage cells either overexpressing EZH2 or E2F3 or repressing STAT3 or ZFX had more cell division, less senescence, improved proteostasis, and enhanced mitochondrial function. These TF perturbations led to similar downstream gene expression programs. In addition, the rejuvenating effects of these TFs were independent of telomeres. We believe our general approach for identifying rejuvenating factors can be applied to other model systems, and some of the top TF perturbations we discovered will lead to future research in novel, safer rejuvenation therapies."

    "abstract": "There is increasing recognition that cells may activate apoptotic caspases but not die, instead displaying various physiologically relevant consequences. We know very little, however, of mechanisms that underlie the life/death decision in a cell that has activated apoptotic caspases. By optimizing a published reporter of past caspase activity, we have been able to visualize such cells that results specifically from exposure to ionizing radiation in Drosophila larval wing discs. We found that cells with X-ray-induced past active caspases (XPAC) do not arise at random but are born at specific locations within the developing wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae. Reduction of apoptotic signaling reduced the prevalence of XPAC cells. Yet, XPAC cells appear in stereotypical patterns that do not follow the pattern of IR-induced apoptosis, suggesting additional controls at play. Functional testing identified the contribution by Wg (Wnt1), Notch and Ras signaling in this process. By following irradiated larvae into adulthood, we found that XPAC cells contribute to the adult wing. To address the relationship between XPAC and genome stability, we combined a reporter for past caspase activity with mwh, an adult marker for Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). Our data suggest that non-lethal caspase activity safeguards the genome by facilitating DNA repair and reducing LOH after transient exposure to X-rays, identifying a physiological role for non-lethal caspase activity during recovery from radiation damage.\n\nAuthor SummaryCells may activate enzymes needed for apoptosis, a form of cell death, yet not die. We found that cells that lived through the activation of apoptotic enzymes after exposure to ionizing radiation show reduced aberrations in their genomes, suggesting that a near-death experience may benefit the cell.\n\nFit for PLoS GeneticsWe make use of Drosophila genetics to address the survival and the fate of cells with past caspase activity, a phenomenon of broad interest. Therefore, this work is a good fit for the readership of PLoS Genetics."

    "abstract": "Increased availability of multi-omics data has facilitated the characterization of metabolic phenotypes of cellular organisms. However, devising genetic interventions that drive cellular organisms toward the desired phenotype remains challenging in terms of time, cost, and resources. Kinetic models, in particular, hold great potential for accelerating this task since they can simulate the metabolic responses to environmental and genetic perturbations. Although the challenges in building kinetic models have been well-documented, there exists no consensus on how to use these models for strain design in a computationally tractable manner. A straightforward approach that exhaustively simulates and evaluates putative designs would be impractical, considering the intensive computational requirements when targeting multiple enzymes. We address this issue by introducing a framework to efficiently scout the space of designs while respecting the physiological requirements of the cell. The framework employs mixed-integer linear programming and nonlinear simulations with large-scale nonlinear kinetic models to devise genetic interventions in a scalable manner while accounting for the network effects of these perturbations. More importantly, the framework ensures the engineered strains robustness by maintaining its phenotype close to that of the reference strain. We use the framework to improve the production of anthranilate, a precursor for pharmaceutical drugs, in E. coli. The devised strategies include previously experimentally validated targets as well as novel designs suitable for experimental implementation. As an essential part of the future design-build-test-learn cycles, we anticipate that this novel framework will enable high throughput designs and accelerated turnover in biotechnological processes."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Caveolins are a unique family of membrane remodeling proteins essential for building flaskshaped nanoscale plasma membrane invaginations that regulate signaling and stress responses in vertebrates known as caveolae. Recent evidence suggests that to generate caveolae, human caveolin-1 assembles into amphipathic disc-shaped complexes consisting of 11 symmetrically arranged protomers, each of which assumes an identical novel fold. Interestingly, caveolins are expressed broadly throughout Metazoa, including in organisms that lack conventional caveolae. The structural features of caveolins that control their functionality in diverse organisms have yet to be established. To address this fundamental question, we use AlphaFold2 as a predictive tool to investigate the structural properties of 72 representative caveolins across evolution. The results of this analysis reveal caveolins consist of six common structural elements that can be mixed and matched, uncover principles that govern their assembly into oligomeric discs, and provide evidence that the association of caveolins with membranes is one of the most ancient functions of the protein. We also identify homologs of caveolins in choanoflagellates, pointing to a pre-metazoan origin of the protein family. Together, these findings define a new structure-based framework for probing the functional roles of caveolins across evolutionary space."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) sequencing is a powerful approach to transcriptome-wide detect binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). High background noise of CLIP protocols and current peak calling strategies, which compare each sequenced library to a single control, result in low replicability and high false-positives rates. Moreover, identified crosslink sites can profoundly deviate from experimentally established functional elements of well-studied RBPs. Here, we present the DEWSeq method to detect significantly enriched crosslink regions using a sliding-window approach that makes full use of replicate information and input control data. We benchmarked DEWSeq on 107 RBPs for which ENCODE produced eCLIP data and associated sequence motifs from catRAPID omics v2.0 were available. Using DEWSeq, the number of motifcontaining binding sites detected increased 1.68 fold relative to standard eCLIP processing, accompanied by a slight improvement in the fraction of binding sites containing known RNA sequence motifs from 56.1% to 59.1%. In particular, DEWSeq results show strong enrichment in known histone stem loop structures for the histone stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and in mitochondrial targets for the mitochondrial RBP FASTKD2 compared to the standard method. Comparison with HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP and iCLIP data also show a consistent improvement of overlap with these orthogonal methods when using DEWSeq on eCLIP data compared to the standard data analysis approach.\n\nDEWSeq is a well-documented R/Bioconductor package, scalable to adequate numbers of replicates, and tends to substantially increase the proportion and total number of RBP binding sites containing biologically relevant features such as known RNA sequence motifs and secondary structures. We envision that the binding site datasets produced as part of this study will be a valuable resource for the community."

    "abstract": "Organisms require mechanisms to distinguish self and non-self RNA. This distinction is crucial to initiate the biogenesis of piRNAs. In Drosophila ovaries, PIWI-guided slicing and the recognition of piRNA precursor transcripts by the DEAD-box RNA helicase Yb are the two known mechanisms to licence an RNA for piRNA biogenesis in the germline and the soma, respectively. Both, the PIWI proteins and Yb are highly conserved across most Drosophila species and are thought to be essential to the piRNA pathway and for silencing transposons. However, we find that species closely related to D. melanogaster have lost the yb gene, as well as the PIWI gene Ago3. We show that the precursor RNA is still selected in the absence of Yb to abundantly generate transposon antisense piRNAs in the soma. We further demonstrate that D. eugracilis, which lacks Ago3, is completely devoid of ping-pong piRNAs and exclusively produces phased piRNAs in the absence of slicing. Thus, there are more possible routes through which the piRNA pathway can achieve specificity than previously suggested."

At least one of its three cysteine (C) residue is functionally essential, and its oxidation state determines the specific function of the enzyme. DJ-1 was recently reported to be persulfidated in mammalian cell lines, but the implications of this post-translational modification have not yet been analyzed. Here, we report that recombinant DJ-1 is reversibly persulfidated at C106 by reaction with various sulfane donors and subsequently inhibited. Strikingly, this reaction is orders of magnitude faster than C106 oxidation by H2O2, and persulfidated DJ-1 behaves differently than sulfinylated DJ-1. Both these PTM most likely play a dedicated role in DJ-1 signaling or protective pathways."

    "abstract": "BackgroundTissues need to regenerate to restore function after injury. Yet, this regenerative capacity varies significantly between organs and between species. For example, in the heart, some species retain full regenerative capacity throughout their lifespan but human cardiac cells display limited ability to repair injury. After a myocardial infarction, the function of cardiomyocytes is impaired and reduces the ability of the heart to pump, causing heart failure. Therefore, there is a need to restore the function of an injured heart post myocardial infarction. We investigate in cell culture the role of the YAP, a transcriptional co-regulator with a pivotal role in growth, in driving repair after injury.\n\nMethodsWe express optogenetic YAP (optoYAP) in three different cell lines. We characterised the behaviour and function of optoYAP using fluorescence imaging and quantitative real-time PCR of downstream YAP target genes. Mutant constructs were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. Nuclear localised optoYAP was functionally tested using wound healing assay and anchorage-independent colony formation assay.\n\nResultsUtilising optoYAP, which enables precise control of pathway activation, we show that YAP induces the expression of downstream genes involved in proliferation and migration. optoYAP can increase the speed of wound healing in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Interestingly, this is not driven by an increase in proliferation, but by collective cell migration. We subsequently dissect specific phosphorylation sites in YAP to identify the molecular driver of accelerated healing.\n\nConclusionsThis study shows that optogenetic YAP is functional in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and its controlled activation can potentially enhance wound healing in a range of conditions."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression in individual cell types from heterogeneous tissue. To date, scRNA-seq studies have focused primarily on expression of protein-coding genes, as the functions of these genes are more broadly understood and more readily linked to phenotype. However, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are even more diverse than protein-coding genes, yet remain an underexplored component of scRNA-seq data. While less is known about lncRNAs, they are widely expressed and regulate cell development and the progression of diseases including cancer and liver disease. Dedicated lncRNA annotation databases continue to expand, but most lncRNA genes are not yet included in reference annotations applied to scRNA-seq analysis. Simply creating a new annotation containing known protein-coding and lncRNA genes is not sufficient, because the addition of lncRNA genes that overlap in sense and antisense with protein-coding genes will affect how reads are counted for both protein-coding and lncRNA genes. Here we introduce Singletrome, an enhanced human lncRNA genome annotation for scRNA-seq analysis, by merging protein-coding and lncRNA databases with additional filters for quality control. Using Singletrome to characterize expression of lncRNAs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and liver scRNA-seq samples, we observed an increase in the number of reads mapped to exons, detected more lncRNA genes, and observed a decrease in uniquely mapped transcriptome reads, indicating improved mapping specificity. Moreover, we were able to cluster cell types based solely on lncRNAs expression, providing evidence of the depth and diversity of lncRNA reads contained in scRNA-seq data. Our analysis identified lncRNAs differentially expressed in specific cell types with development of liver fibrosis. Importantly, lncRNAs alone were able to predict cell types and human disease pathology through the application of machine learning. This comprehensive annotation will allow mapping of lncRNA expression across cell types of the human body facilitating the development of an atlas of human lncRNAs in health and disease."

Clinically, the presence of IKZF1 deletions informs prognosis and treatment options. In this work we developed a method for detecting exon deletions in genes using RNA-seq with application to IKZF1. We developed a pipeline that first uses a custom transcriptome reference consisting of transcripts with exon deletions. Next, RNA-seq reads are mapped using a pseudoalignment algorithm to identify reads that uniquely support deletions. These are then evaluated for evidence of the deletion with respect to gene expression and other samples. We applied the algorithm, named Toblerone, to a cohort of 99 B-ALL paediatric samples including validated IKZF1 deletions. Furthermore, we developed a graphical desktop app for non-bioinformatics users that can quickly and easily identify and report deletions in IKZF1 from RNA-seq data with informative graphical outputs."

SCIP is scalable, flexible, open-source and enables reproducible image processing. It performs projection, illumination correction, segmentation, background masking and extensive morphological profiling on various imaging types.\n\nWe showcase SCIPs capabilities on three large-scale image cytometry datasets. First, we process an imaging flow cytometry (IFC) dataset of human white blood cells and show how the obtained features are used to classify cells into 8 cell types based on bright- and darkfield imagery. Secondly, we process an automated microscopy dataset of human white blood cells to divide them into cell types in an unsupervised manner. Finally, a high-content screening dataset of breast cancer cells is processed to predict the mechanism-of-action of a large set of compound treatments.\n\nThe software can be installed from the PyPi repository.

In image cytometry, this is done by acquiring images of cells. In order to gain biological insight from a set of images, an extensive amount of measurements are derived from them describing the cells they contain. These measurements include, for instance, a cells area, diameter, or the average brightness of the cell image. These measurements can then be analyzed using automated software tools to understand, for example, how cells respond to drug treatments, or how cells differ between a healthy and a diseased person. In this work, we present a novel software tool that is able to efficiently compute image measurements on large datasets of images. We do this by harnessing the power of high performance computing infrastructure. By enabling image cytometry researchers to make use of more computational power, they can more efficiently process complex and large datasets, paving the way to novel, fascinating biological discoveries."

Lacking recent reviews, the field of Hill-type modelling is however dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on knowledge transmission, inter-study consistency, and innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of the field of Hill-type muscle-tendon modelling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and proposing updated terminology and definitions, and discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential improvements in modelling muscle properties. To achieve this aim, fifty-five criteria-abiding studies were extracted using a systematic search and their Hill-type models assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle-tendon properties, and a modelling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the model, and attention given to its modelling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance the dated gold standards in muscle modelling and do not build upon more recent advances, (2) overlook the importance of parameter identification and tuning, (3) are not strongly validated, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary material for understanding the literature, the results of this review open a discussion on the necessity for global recommendations in Hill-type modelling and more frequent reviews to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transmission and model reusability."

Here, we expanded the genomic dataset by sequencing 279 Powassan viruses isolated from Ixodes scapularis ticks from the northeastern United States. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic reconstructions revealed that Powassan virus lineage II was likely introduced or emerged from a relict population in the Northeast between 1940-1975. Sequences strongly clustered by sampling location, suggesting a highly focal geographical distribution. Our analyses further indicated that Powassan virus lineage II emerged in the northeastern U.S. mostly following a south to north pattern, with a weighted lineage dispersal velocity of ~3 km/year. Since the emergence in the Northeast, we found an overall increase in the effective population size of Powassan virus lineage II, but with growth stagnating during recent years. The cascading effect of population expansion of white-tailed deer and I. scapularis populations likely facilitated the emergence of Powassan virus in the northeastern U.S.\n\nSignificance statementOur work provides important fundamental insights in the local transmission dynamics of an emerging tick-borne pathogen of public health concern. Without the availability of vaccines or specific treatments, prevention of Powassan virus infection is dependent on education and control. We identified that Powassan virus is maintained in highly localized transmission foci that have been maintained for several years, without introductions of new virus clades. This provides both opportunities for better education about high risk areas and effective targeted control in Powassan virus foci with a long lasting impact."

Whereas Ang1-mediated Tie2 activation reduces inflammation and endothelial permeability, its antagonist, Ang2 increases it. Increased plasma Ang2 levels are associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute lung injury (ALI), as well as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nIn the study presented here we tested the effect of a novel synthetic, nucleoside-modified mRNA-76 encoding for a hyperactive Ang1 derived fusion protein (COMP-Ang1) on attenuating post-inflammation vascular leakage. COMP-Ang1 mRNA was formulated into a cationic lipid nanoparticle (cLNP) using an optimized mixture of three different lipids and a microfluidic mixing technology. After intravenous injection, the respective mRNA-loaded LNPs were found to be delivered predominantly to the endothelial cells of the lung, while sparing other vascular beds. Also, the specific multimeric folding of the COMP-Ang1 protein complex appeared to be pivotal for its activity in preventing vascular leakage and in restoring the alveolar-endothelial barrier function in the inflamed and injured pulmonary vasculature. The mode of action of mRNA-76, such as its activation of the Tie2 signal transduction pathway, was tested by pharmacological studies in vitro and in vivo by systemic administration in respective mouse models. mRNA-76 was found to prevent lung vascular leakage/lung edema as well as neutrophil infiltration in an LPS-challenging model."

    "abstract": "We seek to transform how new and emergent variants of pandemiccausing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data."

    "date": "2022-11-23",
    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Ras is a small GTPase that regulates fundamental cellular activities. Activated Ras transduces the signalling by directly interacting with effector proteins. About a quarter of total human cancers carry mutations in Ras isoforms, and hence understanding the structure and molecular interactions of Ras with effector proteins is of vital importance. Accumulating evidence suggests that small GTPases, RalA and RalB, and their activators, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), play an essential role in oncogenic Ras-induced signalling. We, therefore, studied the interaction between human K-Ras4B and the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Rgl2 (Rgl2RBD) because, among RBD-containing RalGEFs, Rgl2 is predicted to be most significantly in complex with Ras in over 29 human tissues [Catozzi S, Halasz M, & Kiel C (2021) Predicted  wiring landscape of Ras-effector interactions in 29 human tissues. NPJ Syst Biol Appl 7(1):10]. We show that the affinity between K-Ras4B and Rgl2RBD is increased when K-Ras4B carries oncogenic mutation G12V. The crystal structure of the K-Ras4BG12V: Rgl2RBD complex shows that a 2:2 heterotetramer is formed where the Switch I and Switch II regions of each K-RasG12V molecule interact with both Rgl2RBD molecules. This structural arrangement is highly similar to the H-RasE31K:RALGDS crystal structure and is distinct from the well-characterised Ras:RAFRBD complexes. Importantly, the G12V mutation was found at the dimer interface of K-Ras4BG12V with its partner. Solution state NMR and mass photometry analyses support the heterotetramer formation in solution. Our study reveals a distinct mode of Ras:effector complex formation by RalGEFs, and points to a possibility that K-Ras4BG12V oncogenicity originates from the formation of a stable complex with Rgl2.\n\nSignificance StatementThe best-characterised Ras:effector interaction is the Ras:Raf1 kinase complex that leads to ERK activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that oncogenic Ras signalling does not always hyperactivate ERK and Akt pathways, and the less-studied RalA/B pathway may be a key player in oncogenic-Ras induced tumorigenesis. In this work, we report that the G12V oncogenic K-Ras4B mutation substantially increases the affinity with the Ras associating (RA) domain of Rgl2, an activator of RalA/B. The K-Ras4BG12V:Rgl2RA complex forms a heterotetramer, with the oncogenic mutant residue located directly at the K-Ras4BG12V: K-Ras4BG12V interface. The binding mode is structurally distinct from other Ras:effector complexes, offering a possible mechanistic explanation for how the oncogenic K-Ras4BG12V hyperactivates the RalA/B pathway."

    "relevance": "4 Very Relevant",
    "abstract": "Recent large-scale human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for insomnia have identified more than 200 significant loci. The functional relevance of these loci to the pathogenesis of insomnia is largely unknown. GWAS signals are typically non-coding variants, which are often arbitrarily annotated to the nearest protein-coding gene; however, due to 3D chromatin structure, variants can interact with more distal genes driving their function. The distal gene may, therefore, represent the true causal gene influencing the phenotype. By integrating our high-resolution chromatin interaction maps from neural progenitor cells with phenotypic data from a Drosophila RNAi screen, we prioritized candidate genes that we hypothesized would have deep phylogenetic conservation of sleep function. To determine the conservation of these candidate genes in the context of vertebrate sleep and their relevance to insomnia-like behaviors, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in larval zebrafish for six highly conserved candidate genes and examined sleep-wake behaviors using automated video-tracking. CRISPR mutation of zebrafish orthologs of MEIS1 and SKIV2L produced insomnia-like behaviors, while mutation of ARFGAP2 impaired activity and development in our larval zebrafish model, demonstrating the importance of performing functional validation of GWAS-implicated effector genes to reveal genes influencing disease-relevant mechanisms."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Dynamic systems such as cells or tissues generate, either spontaneously or in response to stimuli, transient signals that carry information about the system. Characterization of recorded transients is often hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Reduction of the noise by filtering has limited use due to partial signal distortion. Occasionally, transients can be approximated by a mathematical function, but such a function may not hold correctly if recording conditions change. We introduce here the model-independent approximation method for general noisy transient signals based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR). The method was implemented in the software TransientAnalyzer, which detects transients in a record, finds their best approximation by the Gaussian process, constructs a surrogate spline function, and estimates specified signal parameters. The method and software were tested on a cellular model of the calcium concentration transient corrupted by various SNR levels and recorded at a low sampling frequency. Statistical analysis of the model data sets provided the error of estimation <7.5% and the coefficient of variation of estimates <17% for peak SNR=5. The performance of GPR on signals of diverse experimental origin was even better than fitting by a function. The software and its description are available on GitHub.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTransient signals convey information on the state and function of the studied system. However, the estimation of their characteristic parameters is complicated by the noise present in the recordings. Methods used for noise reduction have various disadvantages, such as distortion of the time course by filtering, the difficult superposition of many transients for accurate averaging, or a lack of a model for data fitting. In this work, we present a general method for the automatic analysis of noisy transient signals based on Gaussian process regression and its implementation in Python. The method can analyze recorded transients reliably at peak SNR [&ge;] 2 with a precision equivalent to the model-fitting methods."

While SAM regeneration protocols from the methyltransferase (MT) byproduct S-adenosylhomocysteine are available, aminopropyl transferases and radical SAM enzymes are not covered. Here, we report an efficient one-pot system to supply or regenerate SAM and SAM analogues for all three enzyme classes. The systems flexibility is showcased by the transfer of an ethyl group with a cobalamin-dependent radical SAM MT using S-adenosylethionine as a cofactor. This shows the potential of SAM (analogue) supply and regeneration for the application of diverse chemistry, as well as for mechanistic studies using cofactor analogues."

We found that the GDS-15 score cannot simply be multiplied by 2 to obtain the GDS-30 scores. Instead, the optimal formula to estimate the GDS-30 score from the GDS-15 score was: GDS-30_estimated = 1.57 + 1.95 * GDS-15. This formula yielded an estimate of GDS-30 with an explained variance of 79%, compared to 63% when GDS-15 was simply multiplied by 2.

    "abstract": "While protein modification by UFM1 (ufmylation) is highly appreciated as an important post-translational modification, little is known about the mechanisms of the enzymes responsible for this modification and in particular on the UFM1 E3 ligase, UFL1, that for its functionality has to form a complex with another protein DDRGK1 (UFBP1). Here we used AlphaFold2 to generate active, easily expressed, fusion proteins encompassing DDRGK1-UFL1. We then solved the crystal structure of this fusion, explaining the dependency of UFL1 on DDRGK1 to form a stable structure. In addition, we deciphered how UFL1, via its N-terminal helix, binds the E2, UFC1, and in turn, allows ufmylation. This mode of binding suggests a competition between E1 and E3 on E2 binding that is required for the proper transfer of UFM1 in the conjugation machinery."

To better understand the role of this complex in mismatch repair and the determinants of simple sequence repeat mutation predisposition, we performed mutation accumulation in yeast strains with abrogated MutS{beta} function. We demonstrate that mutations in simple sequence repeat loci in the absence of mismatch repair are primarily deletions. We also show that mutations accumulate at drastically different rates in short (<8 bp) and longer repeat loci. These data lend support to a model in which the mismatch repair complex is responsible for repair primarily in longer simple sequence repeats."

MHCII-peptide presentation prediction has multiple biopharmaceutical applications, including the safety assessment of biologics and engineered derivatives in silico, or the fast progression of antigen-specific immunomodulatory drug discovery programs in immune disease and cancer. This has resulted in the collection of large-scale data sets on adaptive immune receptor antigenic responses and MHC-associated peptide proteomics. In parallel, recent deep learning algorithmic advances in protein language modelling (PLM) have shown potential in leveraging large collections of sequence data and improve MHC presentation prediction. Here, we train a compact transformer model (AEGIS) on human and mouse MHCII immunopeptidome data, including a preclinical murine model, and evaluate its performance on the peptide presentation prediction task. We show that the transformer performs on par with existing deep learning algorithms and that combining datasets from multiple organisms increases model performance. We trained variants of the model with and without MHCII information. In both alternatives, the inclusion of peptides presented by the I-Ag7 MHC class II molecule expressed by the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice enabled for the first time the accuratein silico prediction of presented peptides in a preclinical type 1 diabetes model organism, which has promising therapeutic applications.\n\n0.1 Availability and implementationThe source code is available at https://github.com/Novartis/AEGIS."

The temporal dynamics of p53 are thought to be important for its function: it encode input information and are decoded to induce distinct cellular phenotypes. However it remains unclear to what extent the temporal dynamics of p53 reflects the activity of p53-induced gene expression. In this study, we report a multiplexed reporter system that allows us to visualize the transcriptional activity of p53 at the single cell level. Our reporter system features simple and sensitive observation of the transcriptional activity of endogenous p53 to the response elements of various target genes. Using this system, we show that the transcriptional activation of p53 exhibits strong cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The transcriptional activation of p53 by etoposide is highly dependent on the cell cycle but not by UV-C. Finally, we show that our reporter system allows simultaneous visualization of the transcriptional activity of p53 and cell cycle. Our reporter system can thus be a useful tool for studying biological processes involving the p53 signaling pathway.\n\nSummary statementTumor suppressor protein p53 is one of the hub factor of the cellular stress responses.

Coarse-grained simulations, in which multiple atoms are represented by a single interaction site, have predicted a novel mechanism of misfolding exists involving off-pathway, non-covalent lasso entanglements, which are distinct from protein knots and slip knots. These misfolded states can be long-lived kinetic traps, and in some cases are structurally similar to the native state according to those simulations. Here, we examine whether such misfolded states occur in long-time-scale, physics-based all-atom simulations of protein folding. We find they do indeed form, estimate they can persist for weeks, and some have characteristics similar to the native state. Digestion patterns from Limited Proteolysis Mass Spectrometry are consistent with the presence of changes in entanglement in these proteins. These results indicate monomeric proteins can exhibit subpopulations of misfolded, self-entangled states that can explain long-timescale changes in protein structure and function in vivo.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryEntangled misfolded states form in physics-based all-atom simulations of protein folding and have characteristics similar to the native state."

    "abstract": "Humans make a number of choices when they walk, such as how fast and for how long. The preferred steady walking speed seems chosen to minimize energy expenditure per distance traveled. But the speed of actual walking bouts is not only steady, but rather a time-varying trajectory, which can also be modulated by task urgency or an individuals movement vigor. Here we show that speed trajectories and durations of human walking bouts are explained better by an objective to minimize Energy and Time, meaning the total work or energy to reach destination, plus a cost proportional to bout duration. Applied to a computational model of walking dynamics, this objective predicts dynamic speed vs. time trajectories with inverted U shapes. Model and human experiment (N = 10) show that shorter bouts are unsteady and dominated by the time and effort of accelerating, and longer ones are steadier and faster due to energy-per-distance. Individual-dependent vigor may be characterized by the energy one is willing to spend to save a unit of time, which explains why some may walk faster than others, but everyone may have similar-shaped trajectories due to similar walking dynamics. Tradeoffs between energy and time costs can predict transient, steady, and vigor-related aspects of walking."

    "abstract": "In image-based profiling, software extracts thousands of morphological features of cells from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy images, yielding single-cell profiles that can be used for basic research and drug discovery. Powerful applications have been proven, including clustering chemical and genetic perturbations based on their similar morphological impact, identifying disease phenotypes by observing differences in profiles between healthy and diseased cells, and predicting assay outcomes using machine learning, among many others. Here we provide an updated protocol for the most popular assay for image-based profiling, Cell Painting. Introduced in 2013, it uses six stains imaged in five channels and labels eight diverse components of the cell: DNA, cytoplasmic RNA, nucleoli, actin, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. The original protocol was updated in 2016 based on several years experience running it at two sites, after optimizing it by visual stain quality. Here we describe the work of the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium, aiming to improve upon the assay via quantitative optimization, based on the measured ability of the assay to detect morphological phenotypes and group similar perturbations together. We find that the assay gives very robust outputs despite a variety of changes to the protocol and that two vendors dyes work equivalently well. We present Cell Painting version 3, in which some steps are simplified and several stain concentrations can be reduced, saving costs. Cell culture and image acquisition take 1-2 weeks for a typically sized batch of 20 or fewer plates; feature extraction and data analysis take an additional 1-2 weeks.\n\nKey references using this protocolVirtual screening for small-molecule pathway regulators by image-profile matching (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2022.08.003) - recent work examining the ability to use collected Cell Painting profiles to screen for regulators of a number of diverse biological pathways.\n\nJUMP Cell Painting dataset: images and profiles from two billion cells perturbed by 140,000 chemical and genetic perturbations (DOI) - the description of the main JUMP master public data set, using this protocol in the production of >200 TB of image data and >200 TB of measured profiles.\n\nKey data used in this protocolCell Painting, a high-content image-based assay for morphological profiling using multiplexed fluorescent dyes (https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2016.105) - this paper provides the first step-by-step Cell Painting protocol ever released."

    "relevance": "",
    "abstract": "Amyloids are protein aggregates usually associated with their contribution to several diseases e.g., Alzheimers and Parkinsons. However, they are also beneficially utilized by many organisms in physiological roles, such as microbial biofilm formation or hormone storage. Recent studies showed that an amyloid aggregate can affect aggregation of another protein. Such cross-interactions may be crucial for understanding comorbidity of amyloid diseases or influence of microbial amyloids on human amyloidogenic proteins. However, due to demanding experiments, understanding of interaction phenomenon is still limited. Moreover, no dedicated computational method to predict potential amyloid interactions has been available until now. Here, we present PACT - a computational method for prediction of amyloid cross-interactions. The method is based on modeling a heterogenous fibril formed by two amyloidogenic peptides. Stability of the resulting structure is assessed using a statistical potential that approximates energetic stability of a model. Importantly, the method can work with long protein fragments and, as a purely physicochemical approach, it relies very little on training data. PACT was evaluated on data collected in AmyloGraph database and it achieved high values of AUC (0.91) and F1 (0.81). The new method opens a possibility of high throughput studies of amyloid interactions. We used PACT to study interactions of CsgA, a bacterial biofilm protein from several bacterial species inhabiting human intestines, and human Alpha-synuclein protein which is involved in the onset of Parkinsons disease. We show that the method correctly predicted the interactions and highlighted the importance of specific regions in both proteins.\n\nThe tool is available as a web server at: https://pact.e-science.pl/pact/.

    "abstract": "There has been a great deal of research on cell division and its mechanisms; however, its processes have not yet been entirely elucidated. To find novel proteins that regulate cell division, we performed the screening using siRNAs and/or the expression plasmid of the target genes and identified leucine zipper protein 1 (LUZP1). Recent studies have shown that LUZP1 interacts with various proteins and stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton; however, the function of LUZP1 in mitosis is not known. In this study, we found that LUZP1 colocalized with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at the centromere in metaphase and at the central spindle in anaphase and that these LUZP1 localizations were regulated by CPC activity and kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A). Mass spectrometry analysis identified that LUZP1 interacted with death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3), one regulator of the cleavage furrow ingression in cytokinesis. In addition, we found that LUZP1 also interacted with myosin light chain 9 (MYL9), a substrate of DAPK3, and comprehensively inhibited MYL9 phosphorylation by DAPK3. In line with a known role for MYL9 in the actin-myosin contraction, LUZP1 suppression accelerated the constriction velocity at the division plane in our timelapse analysis. Our study indicates that LUZP1 is a novel regulator for cytokinesis that regulates the constriction velocity of the contractile ring."

    "date": "2022-11-28",
    "relevance": "3 Possibly Relevant",
    "abstract": "Multistep protein-protein interactions underlie most biological processes, but their characterization through methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is largely confined to simple models that provide little information on the intermediate, individual steps. In this study, we primarily examine the essential hub protein LC8, a small dimer that binds disordered regions of 100+ client proteins in two symmetrical grooves at the dimer interface. Mechanistic details of LC8 binding have remained elusive, hampered in part by ITC data analyses employing simple models that treat bivalent binding as a single event with a single binding affinity. We build on existing Bayesian ITC approaches to quantify thermodynamic parameters for multi-site binding interactions impacted by significant uncertainty in protein concentration. Using a two-site binding model, we model LC8 binding and identify positive cooperativity with high confidence for multiple client peptides. Application of an identical model to two-site binding between the coiled-coil dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein reveals little evidence of cooperativity, in contrast to LC8. We propose that cooperativity in the LC8 system drives the formation of saturated 2:2 bound states, which play a functional role in many LC8 complexes. In addition to these system-specific findings, our work advances general ITC analysis in two ways. First, we describe a previously unrecognized mathematical ambiguity in concentrations in standard binding models and clarify how it impacts the precision with which binding parameters can be determined in cases of high uncertainty in analyte concentrations. Second, building on observations in the LC8 system, we develop a system-agnostic heat map of practical parameter identifiability calculated from synthetic data which demonstrates that certain binding parameters intrinsically inflate parameter uncertainty in ITC analysis, independent of experimental uncertainties.\n\nAuthor SummaryMulti-site protein-protein interactions govern many protein functions throughout the cell. Precise determination of thermodynamic constants of multi-site binding is a significant biophysical challenge, however. The application of complex models to multi-step interactions is difficult and hampered further by complications arising from uncertainty in analyte concentrations. To address these issues, we utilize Bayesian statistical techniques which calculate the  likelihood of parameters giving rise to experimental observations to build probability density distributions for thermodynamic parameters of binding. To demonstrate the method and improve our understanding how the hub protein LC8 promotes dimerization of its 100+ binding partners, we test the pipeline on several of these partners and demonstrate that LC8 can bind clients cooperatively, driving interactions towards a  fully bound functional state. We additionally examine an interaction between the dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein, which does not appear to bind with cooperativity. Our work provides a solid foundation for future analysis of more complicated binding interactions, including oligomeric complexes formed between LC8 and clients with multiple LC8-binding sites."

    "abstract": "Activation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) by calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM) plays an important role in numerous cellular functions including vascular smooth muscle contraction and cellular motility. Despite extensive biochemical analysis of this system, aspects of the mechanism of activation remain controversial, and competing theoretical models have been proposed for the binding of Ca2+ and CaM to MLCK. The models are analytically solvable for an equilibrium steady state and give rise to distinct predictions that hold regardless of the numerical values assigned to parameters. These predictions form the basis of a recently proposed, multi-part experimental strategy for model discrimination. Here we implement this strategy by measuring CaM-MLCK binding using an in vitro FRET system. This system uses the CaM-binding region of smooth muscle MLCK protein to link two fluorophores to form an MLCK FRET Reporter (FR). Biochemical and biophysical experiments have established that FR can be reliably used to analyze MLCK-CaM binding. We assessed the binding of either wild-type CaM, or mutant CaM with one or more defective EF-hand domains, to FR. Interpretation of binding data in light of the mathematical models suggests a partially ordered mechanism for binding of CaM to MLCK. Complementary data collected using orthogonal approaches that directly quantify CaM-MLCK binding further supports our conclusions."

    "abstract": "Elucidating protein-ligand interaction is crucial for studying the function of proteins and compounds in an organism and critical for drug discovery and design. The problem of protein-ligand interaction is traditionally tackled by molecular docking and simulation based on physical forces and statistical potentials, which cannot effectively leverage cryo-EM data and existing protein structural information in the protein-ligand modeling process. In this work, we developed a deep learning bioinformatics pipeline (DeepProLigand) to predict protein-ligand interactions from cryo-EM density maps of proteins and ligands. DeepProLigand first uses a deep learning method to predict the structure of proteins from cryo-EM maps, which is averaged with a reference (template) structure of the proteins to produce a combined structure to add ligands. The ligands are then identified and added into the structure to generate a protein-ligand complex structure, which is further refined. The method based on the deep learning prediction and template-based modeling was blindly tested in the 2021 EMDataResource Ligand Challenge and was ranked first in fitting ligands to cryo-EM density maps. The results demonstrate the deep learning bioinformatics approach is a promising direction to model protein-ligand interaction on cryo-EM data using prior structural information.

However, the extent of plasmid sharing and evolution between Enterobacterales causing human infections and other niches remains unclear, including the emergence of resistance plasmids. Dense, unselected sampling is highly relevant to developing our understanding of plasmid epidemiology and designing appropriate interventions to limit the emergence and dissemination of plasmid-associated AMR. We established a geographically and temporally restricted collection of human bloodstream infection (BSI)-associated, livestock-associated (cattle, pig, poultry, and sheep faeces, farm soils) and wastewater treatment work (WwTW)-associated (influent, effluent, waterways upstream/downstream of effluent outlets) Enterobacterales. Isolates were collected between 2008-2020 from sites <60km apart in Oxfordshire, UK. Pangenome analysis of plasmid clusters revealed shared \"backbones\", with phylogenies suggesting an intertwined ecology where well-conserved plasmid backbones carry diverse accessory functions, including AMR genes. Many plasmid \"backbones\" were seen across species and niches, raising the possibility that plasmid movement between these followed by rapid accessory gene change could be relatively common. Overall, the signature of identical plasmid sharing is likely to be a highly transient one, implying that plasmid movement might be occurring at greater rates than previously estimated, raising a challenge for future genomic One Health studies.\n\nFundingThis study was funded by the Antimicrobial Resistance Cross-council Initiative supported by the seven research councils and the NIHR, UK."

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThere is still no consensus as to how to select models in Bayesian phylogenetics, and more generally in applied Bayesian statistics. Bayes factors are often presented as the method of choice, yet other approaches have been proposed, such as cross-validation or information criteria. Each of these paradigms raises specific computational challenges, but they also differ in their statistical meaning, being motivated by different objectives: either testing hypotheses or finding the best-approximating model. These alternative goals entail different compromises, and as a result, Bayes factors, cross-validation and information criteria may be valid for addressing different questions. Here, the question of Bayesian model selection is revisited, with a focus on the problem of finding the best-approximating model. Several model selection approaches were re-implemented, numerically assessed and compared: Bayes factors, cross-validation (CV), in its different forms (k-fold or leave-one-out), and the widely applicable information criterion (wAIC), which is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out cross validation (LOO-CV). Using a combination of analytical results and empirical and simulation analyses, it is shown that Bayes factors are unduly conservative. In contrast, cross-validation represents a more adequate formalism for selecting the model returning the best approximation of the data-generating process and the most accurate estimates of the parameters of interest. Among alternative CV schemes, LOO-CV and its asymptotic equivalent represented by the wAIC, stand out as the best choices, conceptually and computationally, given that both can be simultaneously computed based on standard MCMC runs under the posterior distribution."

To overcome this limitation, in a novel end-to-end architecture (named FeatNN), we develop a coevolutionary strategy to jointly represent the structure and sequence features of proteins and ultimately optimize the mathematical models for predicting CPA. Furthermore, from the perspective of data-driven approach, we proposed a rational method that can utilize both high- and low-quality databases to optimize the accuracy and generalization ability of FeatNN in CPA prediction tasks. Notably, we visually interpret the feature interaction process between sequence and structure in the rationally designed architecture. As a result, FeatNN considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline in virtual drug screening tasks, indicating the feasibility of this approach for practical use. FeatNN provides an outstanding method for higher CPA prediction accuracy and better generalization ability by efficiently representing multimodal information of proteins via a coevolutionary strategy."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevelant malignancy in Europe and diet is an important modifiable risk factor. Processed meat consumption, including meats with preservative salts such as sodium nitrite, have been implicated in CRC pathogenesis. This study investigated how the CRC pathology and metabolic status of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) multiple intestinal neoplasia (min) mice was perturbed following 8 weeks of pork meat consumption. Dietary inclusions (15%) of either nitrite-free pork, nitrite-free sausage or nitrite-containing sausage (frankfurter) were compared against a parallel control group (100% chow). Comprehensive studies investigated: gastrointestinal tract histology (tumours, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and mucin deplin foci (MDF), lipid peroxidation (urine and serum), faecal microbiota and serum metabolomics (599 metabolites). After 8 weeks mice consuming the frankfurter diet had 53% more (P=0.014) gastrointestinal tumours than control, although ACF and MDF did not differ. Urine and serum lipid peroxidation markers were 59% (P=0.001) and 108% (P=0.001) higher, respectively in the frankfurter group. Gut dysbiosis was evident in these mice with comparably fewer Bacteriodes and more Firmicutes. Fasting serum levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and numerous triglycerides were elevated. Various serum phosphotidylcholine species were decreased. These results demonstrate that nitrite-containing sausages may exaccerbate the development of CRC pathology in APCMin mice to a greater extent than nitrite-free sausages, and this is associated with greater lipid peroxidation, wide-ranging metabolic alternation and gut dysbiosis."

    "abstract": "Antibiotics can kill or stop the growth of bacteria, and their effectiveness depends on many factors. It is important to understand the relation between bacterial physiology, the environment and antibiotic action. While many of the mechanistic details of antibiotic action are known, the connection between death rate and bacterial physiology is poorly understood. Death rate in antibiotics has often been shown to rise linearly with growth rate; however, it remains unclear how environmental factors, in concert with whole-cell physiological properties, affect bactericidal activity. To address this, we developed a high-throughput assay to precisely measure antibiotic-mediated bacterial death. We found that death rate is linear in growth rate, but the slope depends on environmental conditions. Specifically, stressors lower the death rate compared to a non-stressed environment with the same growth rate. To understand the role of stress, we developed a mathematical model of bacterial death based on resource allocation that takes into account a newly defined stress-response sector; we identify this sector using RNA-seq. Our model accurately predicts the death rate and minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics across a wide range of conditions, including a previously unknown increase in the stress response and protection from death at very low levels of cAMP. The present death-growth model suggests conditions that may improve antibiotic efficacy."

    "abstract": "Stress triggers anticipatory physiological responses that promote survival, a phenomenon termed allostasis. However, the chronic activation of energy-dependent allostatic responses results in allostatic load, a dysregulated state that predicts functional decline, accelerates aging, and increases mortality in humans. The energetic cost and cellular basis for the damaging effects of allostatic load have not been defined. By longitudinally profiling primary human fibroblasts across their lifespan, we find that chronic glucocorticoid exposure induces a ~60% increase in cellular energy expenditure and a greater reliance on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) rather than glycolysis. We show that this state of stress-induced hypermetabolism is linked to mtDNA instability, affects age-related cytokines secretion, and accelerates cellular aging based on DNA methylation clocks, telomere shortening rate, and reduced lifespan. Pharmacologically normalizing OxPhos activity while further increasing energy expenditure exacerbates the accelerated aging phenotype. Altogether, our findings define bioenergetic and multi-omic recalibrations of stress adaptation, underscoring increased energy expenditure and accelerated cellular aging as interrelated features of cellular allostatic load."

Recently, nematode individuals have been reanimated from Siberian permafrost after remaining in cryptobiosis. Preliminary analysis indicates that these nematodes belong to the genera Panagrolaimus and Plectus4. Here, we present precise radiocarbon dating indicating that the Panagrolaimus individuals have remained in cryptobiosis since the late Pleistocene ([~]46,000 years). Phylogenetic inference based on our genome assembly and a detailed morphological analysis demonstrate that they belong to an undescribed species, which we named Panagrolaimus n. sp. Comparative genome analysis revealed that the molecular toolkit for cryptobiosis in Panagrolaimus n. sp. and in C. elegans is partly orthologous. We show that biochemical mechanisms employed by these two species to survive desiccation and freezing under laboratory conditions are similar. Our experimental evidence also reveals that C. elegans dauer larvae can remain viable for longer periods in suspended animation than previously reported. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that nematodes evolved mechanisms potentially allowing them to suspend life over geological time scales."

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSystematic differences between batches of samples present significant challenges when analysing biological data. Such batch effects are well-studied and are liable to occur in any setting where multiple batches are assayed. Many existing methods for accounting for these have focused on high-dimensional data such as RNA-seq and have assumptions that reflect this. Here we focus on batch-correction in low-dimensional classification problems. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian generative classifier based on mixture models that jointly predicts class labels and models batch effects. Our model allows observations to be probabilistically assigned to classes in a way that incorporates uncertainty arising from batch effects. By simultaneously inferring the classification and the batch-correction our method is more robust to dependence between batch and class than pre-processing steps such as ComBat. We explore two choices for the within-class densities: the multivariate normal and the multivariate t. A simulation study demonstrates that our method performs well compared to popular off-the-shelf machine learning methods and is also quick; performing 15,000 iterations on a dataset of 750 samples with 2 measurements each in 11.7 seconds for the MVN mixture model and 14.7 seconds for the MVT mixture model. We further validate our model on gene expression data where cell type (class) is known and simulate batch effects. We apply our model to two datasets generated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a spectrophotometric assay often used to screen for antibodies. The examples we consider were collected in 2020 and measure seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. We use our model to estimate seroprevalence in the populations studied. We implement the models in C++ using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, available in the R package batchmix.

    "abstract": "High-resolution respirometry (HRR) can assess PBMC bioenergetics, but no standardized medium for PBMC preparation and HRR analysis exist. Here, we study the effect of four different media (MiR05, PBS, RPMI, Plasmax) on quantification, size, and HRR analysis (Oxygraph-O2k) of intact PBMCs. Remarkably, PBMC quantification was 21% higher in MiR05 than PBS and Plasmax, and 28% higher than in RPMI, causing O2 flux underestimation during HRR due to inherent adjustments. Moreover, smaller cell size of PBMCs and aggregation was observed in MiR05. We suggest optimization of HRR with a standardized, plasma-like medium for future HRR analysis of intact PBMCs."

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptome assembly from RNA-sequencing data in species without a reliable reference genome has to be performed de novo, but studies have shown that de novo methods often have inadequate ability to reconstruct transcript isoforms. We address this issue by constructing an assembly pipeline whose main purpose is to produce a comprehensive set of transcript isoforms.\n\nResultsWe present the de novo transcript isoform assembler ClusTrast, which clusters a set of guiding contigs by similarity, aligns short reads to the guiding contigs, and assembles each clustered set of short reads individually. We tested ClusTrast on datasets from six eukaryotic species, and showed that ClusTrast reconstructed more expressed known isoforms than any of the other tested de novo assemblers, at a moderate reduction in precision. For recall, ClusTrast was on top in the lower end of expression levels (<15% percentile) for all tested datasets, and over the entire range for almost all datasets. Reference transcripts were often (35-69% for the six datasets) reconstructed to at least 95% of their length by ClusTrast, and more than half of reference transcripts (58-81%) were reconstructed with contigs that exhibited polymorphism, measuring on a subset of reliably predicted contigs.\n\nConclusionWe suggest that ClusTrast can be a useful tool for studying isoforms in species without a reliable reference genome, in particular when the goal is to produce a comprehensive transcriptome set with polymorphic variants."

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are multi-faceted organelles crucial for cellular homeostasis that contain their own genome. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) codes for several essential components of the electron transport chain, and mtDNA maintenance defects lead to mitochondrial diseases. mtDNA replication occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites and is regulated by mitochondrial dynamics. Specifically, mitochondrial fusion is essential for mtDNA maintenance. In contrast, while loss of mitochondrial fission causes the aggregation of nucleoids (mtDNA-protein complexes), its role in nucleoid distribution remains unclear. Here, we show that contact sites between mitochondria and ER sheets, the ER structure associated with protein synthesis, regulate mtDNA replication and nucleoid distribution within mitochondrial networks. Specifically, DRP1 loss or mutation leads to altered ER sheets and enhanced physical interaction with mitobulbs, mitochondrial structures containing aggregated nucleoids. Importantly, nucleoid distribution and mtDNA replication were rescued by expressing the ER sheet protein CLIMP63. Thus, our work identifies a novel role of ER sheets-mitochondria contact sites in regulating mtDNA replication and distribution."

    "abstract": "Due to their exquisite position on glomerular capillaries, podocytes are continuously counteracting biomechanical filtration forces. Most therapeutic interventions known to generally slow or prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease appear to lower the biochemical forces on podocytes, highlighting the critical need to better understand podocyte mechano-signalling pathways.\n\nHere we investigated the hypothesis that the mechanotransducer Piezo is involved in a mechanotransduction pathway in Drosophila nephrocytes, the podocyte homologue in the fly. We find Piezo is expressed in nephrocytes and podocytes and localizes to the slit/nephrocyte diaphragm. Piezo activation leads to a significant increase in intracellular Ca++ upon exposure to shear stress and an activation of Rho1 in nephrocytes. Loss of function analysis in Piezo knockout nephrocytes revealed only minor defects in nephrocyte filtration function. In contrast, we show that elevated Piezo levels resulted in constitutive Ca++ oscillations even in the absence of shear stress, increased active Rho1 and accumulation of actin stress fibers, culminating in a severe nephrocyte filtration phenotype, suggesting that pathway hyperactivity is detrimental. Blocking Piezo activity using the tarantula toxin GsMTx4 reversed levels of activated Rho1 into the normal range. Thus, Piezo-mediated mechano-signalling acts as surveillance mechanism by which nephrocytes sense and adapt to changes in mechanical force."

This unprecedented large-scale availability of data provides an opportunity for combined analyses of datasets to get organism-wide protein abundance data in a consistent manner. We have reanalysed 24 public proteomics datasets from healthy human individuals, to assess baseline protein abundance in 31 organs. We defined tissue as a distinct functional or structural region within an organ. Overall, the aggregated dataset contains 67 healthy tissues, corresponding to 3,119 mass spectrometry runs covering 498 samples, coming from 489 individuals.\n\nWe compared protein abundances between the different organs and studied the distribution of proteins across organs. We also compared the results with data generated in analogous studies. We also performed gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses to identify organ-specific enriched biological processes and pathways. As a key point, we have integrated the protein abundance results into the resource Expression Atlas, where it can be accessed and visualised either individually or together with gene expression data coming from transcriptomics datasets. We believe this is a good mechanism to make proteomics data more accessible for life scientists."

    "abstract": "Experimental studies reveal that genome architecture splits into DNA sequence domains suggesting a well-structured genomic architecture, where, for each species, genome populations are integrated by individual mutational variants. Herein, we show that, consistent with the fundamental theorem of Abelian finite groups, the architecture of population genomes from the same or closed related species can be quantitatively represented in terms of the direct sum of homocyclic Abelian groups of prime-power order defined on the genetic code and on the set of DNA bases, where populations can be stratified into subpopulations with the same canonical decomposition into p-groups. Through concrete examples we show that the architectures of current annotated genomic regions including (but not limited to) transcription factors binding-motif, promoter regulatory boxes, exon and intron arrangement associated to gene splicing are subjects for feasible modeling as decomposable Abelian p-groups. Moreover, we show that the epigenomic variations induced by diseases or environmental changes also can be represented as an Abelian group decomposable into homocyclic Abelian p-groups. The nexus between the direct sum of homocycle Abelian p-groups and the endomorphism ring paved the ways to unveil unsuspected stochastic-deterministic logical propositions ruling the ensemble of genomic regions. Our study aims to set the basis for concrete applications of the theory in computational biology and bioinformatics. Consistently with this goal, a computational tool designed for the analysis of fixed mutational events in gene/genome populations represented as endomorphisms and automorphisms is provided. Results suggest that complex local architectures and evolutionary features no evident through the direct experimentation can be unveiled through the analysis of the endomorphism ring and the subsequent application of machine learning approaches for the identification of stochastic-deterministic logical rules (reflecting the evolutionary pressure on the region) constraining the set of possible mutational events (represented as homomorphisms) and the evolutionary paths."

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry is commonly used to characterize nanoparticles (NPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) but results are often expressed in arbitrary units to indicate fluorescence intensity. This hampers interlaboratory and inter-platform comparisons. We investigated the use of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophores (MESF)-beads for assignment of fluorescence values to NPs and EVs by comparing two FITC-MESF bead sets as calibrators on different flow cytometry platforms (BD Influx, CytoFLEX LX and SORP BD FACSCelesta). Next, fluorescence signals of NPs and EVs were calibrated using different sets of FITC and PE-MESF beads. Fluorescence calibration using beads designed for cellular flow cytometry allowed inter-platform comparison. However, the intrinsic uncertainty in the fluorescence assignment to these MESF beads impacts the reliable assignment of MESF values to NPs and EVs based on extrapolation into the dim fluorescence range. Our findings demonstrate that the use of the same set of calibration materials (vendor and lot number) and the same number of calibration points, greatly improves robust interlaboratory and inter-platform comparison of fluorescent submicron sized particles."

However, the transcription factors and gene regulatory networks underlying cellular identity in the human adult pancreas remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of the human adult pancreas, totaling 7393 cells, and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory networks. We show that a network of 142 transcription factors forms distinct regulatory modules that characterize pancreatic cell types. We present evidence that our approach identifies regulators of cell identity in the human adult pancreas. We predict that HEYL, BHLHE41 and JUND are active in acinar, beta and alpha cells, respectively, and show that these proteins are present in the human adult pancreas as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived islet cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we found that JUND represses beta cell genes in hiPSC-alpha cells. Both BHLHE41 and JUND depletion seemed to increase the number of sc-enterochromaffin cells in hiPSC-derived islets. The comprehensive gene regulatory network atlas can be explored interactively online. We anticipate our analysis to be the starting point for a more sophisticated dissection of how transcription factors regulate cell identity in the human adult pancreas. Furthermore, given that transcription factors are major regulators of embryo development and are often perturbed in diseases, a comprehensive understanding of how transcription factors work will be relevant in development and disease.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIReconstruction of gene regulatory networks for human adult pancreatic cell types\nC_LIO_LIAn interactive resource to explore and visualize gene expression and regulatory states\nC_LIO_LIPrediction of putative transcription factors that drive pancreatic cell identity\nC_LIO_LIBHLHE41 depletion in primary islets induces apoptosis\nC_LI"
