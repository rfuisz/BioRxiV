Here we present a new deep learning method referred to as PLMGraph-Inter for inter-protein contact prediction. Specifically, we employ rotationally and translationally invariant geometric graphs obtained from structures of interacting proteins to integrate multiple protein language models, which are successively transformed by graph encoders formed by geometric vector perceptrons and residual networks formed by dimensional hybrid residual blocks to predict inter-protein contacts. Extensive evaluation on multiple test sets shows that PLMGraph-Inter significantly outperforms three top inter-protein contact prediction methods, including DRN-1D2D_Inter, DeepHomo and GLINTER.

Most unsupervised peak calling methods are based on simple statistical models and suffer from elevated false positive rates. Newly developed supervised deep learning methods can be successful, but they rely on high quality labeled data for training, which can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, though biological replicates are recognized to be important, there are no established approaches for using replicates in the deep learning tools, and the approaches available for traditional methods either cannot be applied to ATAC-seq, where control samples may be unavailable, or are post-hoc and do not capitalize on potentially complex, but reproducible signal in the read enrichment data. Here, we propose a novel peak caller that uses unsupervised contrastive learning to extract shared signals from multiple replicates. Raw coverage data are encoded to obtain low-dimensional embeddings and optimized to minimize a contrastive loss over biological replicates. These embeddings are passed to another contrastive loss for learning and predicting peaks and decoded to denoised data under an autoencoder loss.

Experimental panel assay protocols are routinely used as a standard procedure to evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of a drug candidate to target kinase. However, current kinase panel assays are time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the panel assay protocols neither provide insights on binding sites nor allow experiments on mutated sequences or newly-characterized kinases. Existing virtual screening or docking simulation technologies require extensive computational resources, thus it is not practical to use them for the panel of kinases. With rapid advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies, a number of DTI tools have been developed over the years. However, these methods are yet to achieve prediction accuracies at the level of practical use. In addition, the performances of current DTI tools vary significantly depending on test sets. In this case, an ensemble model can be used to improve and stabilize DTI prediction accuracies.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose an ensemble model, EnsDTI-kinase, that integrates eight existing machine learning and deep learning models into a unified model deployed as a web-server. Upon submission of a compound SMILES string, potential target kinases are automatically predicted and evaluated on the web-server. Importantly, EnsDTI-kinase is a computational platform where newly developed DTI tools can be easily incorporated without modifying core components so that its DTI prediction quality can improve over time. Besides, many useful functionalities are provided on our platform for users to further investigate predicted DTI: it allows confidence experiments by changing the amino acid (AA) at a specific position in a kinase sequence, named in silico mutagenesis, to investigate the effect of AA changes in binding affinity; it predicts kinase sequential regions where the query compound likely binds to by slidingly masking the sequence of selected kinases so that confidence in the predicted binding sites can be evaluated. Our model was evaluated in three experimental settings using four independent datasets, and showed accuracy of 0.82 compared to the average accuracy of 0.69 from five deep learning methods on the ChEMBL dataset. It achieved average selectivity of 0.95 within kinase families such as TK, CAMK and STE. For 8 out of 17 recent drugs, our model successfully predicted their interactions with 404 proteins at average accuracy of 0.82.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/ensdti\n\nContactsunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr"}, {"category": "bioinformatics", "authors": "Chandra, G.; Jain, C.", "author_corresponding_institution": "Indian Institute of Science", "author_corresponding": "Chirag Jain", "doi": "10.1101/2022.08.29.505691", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2022.08.29.505691", "title": "Sequence to graph alignment using gap-sensitive co-linear chaining", "date": "2023-01-08", "relevance": "2 Probably Irrelevant", "abstract": "Co-linear chaining is a widely used technique in sequence alignment tools that follow seed-filter-extend methodology. It is a mathematically rigorous approach to combine short exact matches. For colinear chaining between two sequences, efficient subquadratic-time chaining algorithms are well-known for linear, concave and convex gap cost functions [Eppstein et al. JACM92]. However, developing extensions of chaining algorithms for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been challenging. Recently, a new sparse dynamic programming framework was introduced that exploits small path cover of pangenome reference DAGs, and enables efficient chaining [Makinen et al. TALG19, RECOMB18]. However, the underlying problem formulation did not consider gap cost which makes chaining less effective in practice. To address this, we develop novel problem formulations and optimal chaining algorithms that support a variety of gap cost functions. We demonstrate empirically the ability of our provably-good chaining implementation to align long reads more precisely in comparison to existing aligners. For mapping simulated long reads from human genome to a pangenome DAG of 95 human haplotypes, we achieve 98.7% precision while leaving < 2% reads unmapped.\n\nImplementationhttps://github.com/at-cg/minichain"}, {"category": "genomics", "authors": "Moorthi, S.; Paguirigan, A.; Ko, M.; Pettinger, M.; Hoge, A.

Nevertheless, we show temporal activation of G protein using a self-inactivating invertebrate opsin, Platynereis c-opsin1, drives biased signaling for G{beta}{gamma}-dependent GIRK channel activation in a light-dependent manner by utilizing the kinetic difference between G{beta}{gamma}-dependent and Ga-dependent responses. The opsin-induced transient Gi/o activation preferably causes activation of the kinetically-fast G{beta}{gamma}-dependent GIRK channels rather than slower Gi/o-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Although similar G{beta}{gamma}-biased signaling properties were observed in a selfinactivating vertebrate visual pigment, Platynereis c-opsin1 needs fewer retinal molecules to evoke cellular responses. Furthermore, the G{beta}{gamma}-biased signaling properties of Platynereis c-opsinl are enhanced by genetically fused with RGS8 protein which accelerates G protein inactivation.

When compared with vertebrates, the invertebrate genomes underwent a drastic expansion in the number of the nACh-like genes associated with receptors of unknown function. Understanding this diversity contributes to better insight into the evolution and possible functional divergence of these receptors.

We solved the first cryo-EM structure of a lophotrochozoan nACh-like receptor in which a CHAPS molecule is tightly bound to the orthosteric site. We show that the binding of CHAPS leads to extending of the loop C at the orthosteric site and a clockwise quaternary twist between extracellular and transmembrane domains. Both the ligand binding site and the channel pore reveal unique features. These include a conserved Trp residue in loop B of the ligand binding site which is flipped into an apparent self-liganded state in the apo structure.

Experiments are evaluated on a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including protein-protein interface prediction, model quality assessment, protein-protein rigid-body docking, and binding affinity prediction, leading to an overall improvement of 20% over baselines and the new state-of-the-art performance. Strong evidence indicates that the incorporation of protein language models knowledge enhances geometric networks capacity by a significant margin and can be generalized to complex tasks."}, {"category": "bioinformatics", "authors": "Zietz, M.; Himmelstein, D.

The number of edges connecting to a node, termed degree, can vary greatly across nodes in real biomedical networks, and the distribution of degrees varies between networks. If degree strongly influences edge prediction, then imbalance or bias in the distribution of degrees could lead to nonspecific or misleading predictions. We introduce a network permutation framework to quantify the effects of node degree on edge prediction. Our framework decomposes performance into the proportions attributable to degree and the networks specific connections. We discover that performance attributable to factors other than degree is often only a small portion of overall performance. Degrees predictive performance diminishes when the networks used for training and testing--despite measuring the same biological relationships--were generated using distinct techniques and hence have large differences in degree distribution. We introduce the permutation-derived edge prior as the probability that an edge exists based only on degree. The edge prior shows excellent discrimination and calibration for 20 biomedical networks (16 bipartite, 3 undirected, 1 directed), with AUROCs frequently exceeding 0.85. Researchers seeking to predict new or missing edges in biological networks should use the edge prior as a baseline to identify the fraction of performance that is nonspecific because of degree.

Through RNA sequencing and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) sequencing analysis, we found that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), a critical enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is negatively regulated by the methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in fibrotic kidneys, which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR, CUT&Tag and Western blotting analysis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys and renal cells. We further showed that pharmaceutical inhibition or conditional knockout of EZH2 increased PCK1 expression and attenuated renal fibrosis in two other mouse models. Moreover, the concentration of lactate, a glucogenic metabolic intermediate, was increased in mouse fibrotic kidneys, which was reduced by EZH2 inhibition. We further showed that glucose production was impaired in folic acid induced nephrotic mice and restored by EZH2 inhibition as assessed by pyruvate tolerance test. Importantly, the direct anti-gluconeogenesis effect of EZH2 on renal proximal epithelial cells was shown in human HK2 cells by analysis of gluconeogenic gene expression and production of glucose or lactate. Finally, inhibition of PCK1 by 3-mercaptopropionic acid abrogated the anti-fibrotic effect of EZH2 inhibitor in UUO kidneys.

The hydrogels exhibit emerging patterns in stiffness and degradability over time, taking advantage of dual Diels-Alder covalent crosslinking and UV-mediated peptide crosslinking.

Live/dead staining showed no differences in cell viability but distinct patterns in proliferation, with higher cell number in Stiff-Deg materials at day 14. Patterns of projected cell area became visible already at day 1, with larger values in Soft-NoDeg materials. This was inverted at day 14, when larger projected cell areas were identified in Stiff-Deg. This shift was accompanied by a significant decrease in cell circularity in Stiff-Deg. The control of anisotropic cell morphology by the material patterns was also confirmed by a significant increase in filopodia number and length in Stiff-Deg materials.

In this study, we report that AhR regulates GSTs thus conferring lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in C. pomonella. Spatiotemporal expression patterns indicated that AhR gene of C. pomonella (CpAhR) was highly expressed in the Malpighian tubules of larvae. Moreover, the expression of CpAhR was induced by lambda-cyhalothrin exposure and was up-regulated in a lambda-cyhalothrin-resistant population. RNA interference (RNAi) of the expression of CpAhR could effectively decrease the relative expression level of CpGSTe3 and enzyme activity of GSTs, but not P450s, further reducing the tolerance of larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin. Furthermore, {beta}-naphthoflavone (BNF), a novel agonist of AhR, can effectively increase the expression of CpAhR and the activity of the GSTs enzyme, resulting in the enhancement of larvae tolerance to lambda-cyhalothrin.

Thus, the ability to assign peptide sequences to the acquired tandem mass spectra without prior information--de novo peptide sequencing--is valuable for gaining biological insights for tasks including antibody sequencing, immunopeptidomics, and metaproteomics. Although many methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, it remains an outstanding challenge, in part due to the difficulty of modeling the irregular data structure of tandem mass spectra.

We further observe that upon tallying the populations of each individual frequency for all residues along the frequency spectrum, there is a regular alternation between high and low population counts along the increasing frequency values in the spectrum. This alternation of the counts becomes less pronounced and ultimately stabilizes as the frequency values increase. These observations thus suggest a regularity and propensity in the spike proteins dihedral angles to avoid similar oscillation population counts between vicinal frequencies. We also observe that for amino acids that are least abundant in the S protein, there are certain frequencies at which the dihedral angles never oscillate, in contrast to relatively abundant amino acids that ultimately cover the entire spectrum. This suggests that the frequency components of dihedral angle oscillations may also be a function of position in the primary structure: the more positions an amino acid is found in, the more frequencies it can sample. Lastly, certain residues identified in the literature as constituting the inside of a druggable pocket of the spike protein, as well as other residues identified as allosteric sites, are observed in our data to have distinctive time domain profiles. This motivates us to propose residues from our dynamic data, with similar time domain profiles, which may be of potential interest to the vaccine and drug design communities, for further investigation.

The position of the polyA tail can vary, with multiple alternatively polyadenylated (APA) transcripts existing for a single gene. This can lead to different length transcripts which can vary in their 3 regulatory domains and even by inclusion or exclusion of protein-coding introns. The distribution of polyA tail location on articular chondrocyte transcripts has not been examined before and this study aimed to be the first to define polyadenylation events in human chondrocytes using age-matched healthy and osteoarthritic knee articular cartilage samples. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples and analysed using the QuantSeqReverse 3 RNA Sequencing approach, where each read runs 3 to 5 from within the polyA tail into the transcript and will contains a distinct polyA site. Initial analysis of differential expression of overall transcript abundance identified by the reads showed significant disruption to transcript levels when healthy samples were compared to osteoarthritic ones. As we expected, differentially regulated genes were enriched with functionalities that were strongly associated with joint pathology. As part of this analysis, we also identified a substantial number of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs that had not been linked to osteoarthritis before. Subsequent examination of polyA site data allowed us to deifne the extent of site usage across all the samples. This included identification of chondrocyte genes that exhibited the greatest amount polyA site variation. When comparing healthy and osteoarthritic samples, we found that differential use of polyadenylation sites was modest. However, of the small number of genes affected, there was clear potential for the change in polyadenylation site usage elicited by pathology to have functional relevance. We examined two genes, OSMR and KMT2A, in more detail, defining how APA affects transcript turnover and then, in the case of OSMR, identifying that APA is sensitive to inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Overall, we have characterised the polyadenylation landscape of human knee articular chondrocytes but can conclude that osteoarthritis does not elicit a widespread change in their polyadenylation site usage. This finding differentiates knee osteoarthritis from pathologies such as cancer where APA is more commonly observed."}, {"category": "bioinformatics", "authors": "Hong, H.; Cortez, M.

With prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein.

Despite numerous options to tackle hypertrophic scarring, efficient therapies are still scarce, and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Secreted factors from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) were previously described for their beneficial effects in tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the effects of PBMCsec on skin scarring in mouse models and human scar explant cultures at single cell resolution (scRNAseq).\n\nMethodsMouse wounds and scars were treated with PBMCsec either intradermally or topically. Human mature scars were treated with PBMCsec ex vivo in explant cultures. All experimental settings were analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). A variety of bioinformatics approaches were used to decipher gene regulation in the scRNAseq data sets. Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were investigated in situ by immunofluorescence. The effect of PBMCsec on myofibroblast differentiation and elastin expression was investigated by stimulating human primary fibroblasts with TGF{beta}.\n\nFindingsTopical and intradermal application of PBMCsec regulated the expression of a variety of genes involved in pro-fibrotic processes and tissue remodeling. Our bioinformatics approach identified elastin as a common linchpin of antifibrotic action in both, the mouse and human experimental setting. In vitro, we found that PBMCsec prevents TGF{beta}-mediated myofibroblast-differentiation and attenuates abundant elastin expression through non-canonical signaling inhibition. Furthermore, TGF{beta}-induced breakdown of elastic fibers was strongly inhibited by addition of PBMCsec.\n\nInterpretationTogether, we showed anti-fibrotic effect of PBMCsec on cutaneous scars in mouse and human experimental settings, suggesting PBMCsec as a novel therapeutic option to treat skin scarring.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSParacrine factors secreted from irradiated peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) show strong tissue regenerative properties in a variety of organs and are shown to enhance cutaneous wound healing.

This threat is aggravated by their rapidly evolving genomes that adapt to evade host plant defenses, reducing the efficacy of deployed resistant crops.

Transposable elements (TEs) are hypothesized to be involved in the evolution and rapid adaptation of M. oryzae. However, there is still much to understand about how these elements behave in different M. oryzae host-specific lineages. In this study, we completed the annotation and phylogenetic classification of TEs in five lineages of M. oryzae. We identified differences in TE content between these lineages, and showed that recent lineage-specific expansions of certain TEs have contributed to greater TE content in rice-infecting and Setaria-infecting lineages. We reconstructed the histories of LTR-retrotransposon expansions and found them to have experienced complex dynamics, where some were caused by the proliferation of one element, while others consisted of multiple elements from an older population of TEs that proliferated in parallel. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting the recent transfer of a DNA transposon between rice and wheat M. oryzae lineages, and a region showing evidence of recombination between those lineages, which could have facilitated such a transfer.

Genotyping by sequencing is progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias.

Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% consisting of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (unique regions). We designed a custom set of 566,722 gRNAs targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats and excluding repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed 40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to unique regions by 2.6-fold. This repeat-to-unique shift in the sequencing data increased the number of genotyped bases by up to 17-fold compared to non-depleted libraries. We were also able to identify up to 18-fold more genetic variants in the unique regions and increased the genotyping accuracy by rescuing thousands of heterozygous variants that otherwise would be missed due to low coverage. The method performed similarly regardless of the multiplexing level, type of library or genotypes, including different cultivars and a closely-related species (L. orientalis).

We present in silico and experimental findings that support RBPMS splicing activity as mediated through direct binding and via functional cooperativity with splicing factor RBFOX2 on a significant subset of targets. Finally, we demonstrate that RBPMS is capable of altering the motility and the proliferative properties of hES-VSMCs to mimic a more differentiated state.

We analyzed the expression of each isoform by deleting an enhancer or insulator, or by opening chromatin at the enhancer location. Our results show that each enhancer promotes expression from a specific TAL1 promoter. Expression from a specific promoter gives rise to a unique 5 UTR with differential regulation of translation. In addition, the enhancers regulate TAL1 exon 3 alternative splicing by altering the chromatin at its location. Furthermore, our results indicate that TAL1-short binds more strongly to TAL1 E-protein partners and functions as a stronger transcription factor than TAL1-long. Specifically TAL1-short has a unique transcription signature promoting apoptosis. Finally, when we expressed both isoforms in mice bone-marrow, we found that while overexpression of both isoforms prevents lymphoid differentiation, expression of TAL-short alone leads to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion.

All cases of FOP are caused by mutations in the type I BMP receptor gene ACVR1 that result in over-activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Activation of the wild-type ACVR1 kinase requires assembly of a tetrameric type I and II BMP receptor complex followed by phosphorylation of the ACVR1 GS domain by type II BMP receptors. Previous studies showed that the FOP mutant ACVR1-R206H requires type II BMP receptors and presumptive GS domain phosphorylation for over-active signaling. Structural modeling of the FOP-ACVR1 mutant kinase domain supports that FOP mutations alter the conformation of the GS domain, but it is unclear how this leads to overactive signaling. Here we show using a developing zebrafish embryo BMP signaling assay that the FOP mutant receptors ACVR1-R206H and -G328R have reduced requirements for GS domain phosphorylation sites to signal compared to wild-type ACVR1. Further, ligandindependent and ligand-dependent signaling through the FOP ACVR1 receptors have distinct GS domain phosphorylation site requirements. Moreover, ACVR1-G328 showed increased GS domain serine/threonine requirements for ligand-independent signaling compared to ACVR1-R206H, whereas it exhibited reduced serine/threonine requirements for ligand-dependent signaling. Remarkably, while ACVR1-R206H does not require the type I BMP receptor partner, Bmpr1, to signal, a ligand-dependent GS domain mutant of ACVR1-R206H could signal independently of Bmpr1 only when Bmp7 ligand was overexpressed. Of note, unlike human ACVR1-R206H, the zebrafish paralog Acvr1l-R203H does not show increased signaling activity. However, in domain-swapping studies the human kinase domain, but not the human GS domain, was sufficient to confer overactive signaling to the Acvr1l-R203H receptor. Together these results reflect the importance of GS domain activation and kinase domain functions in regulating ACVR1 signaling and identify mechanisms of reduced regulatory constraints conferred by FOP mutations."}, {"category": "biophysics", "authors": "Krishnan, K.; Tian, H.; Tao, P.; Verkhivker, G.", "author_corresponding_institution": "Chapman University School of Pharmacy", "author_corresponding": "Gennady Verkhivker", "doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518410", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.11.29.518410", "title": "Probing Conformational Landscapes and Mechanisms of Allosteric Communication in the Functional States of the ABL Kinase Domain Using Multiscale Simulations and Network-Based Mutational Profiling of Allosteric Residue Potentials", "date": "2022-12-02", "relevance": "2 Probably Irrelevant", "abstract": "In the current study, multiscale simulation approaches and dynamic network methods are employed to examine the dynamic and energetic details of conformational landscapes and allosteric interactions in the ABL kinase domain that determine the kinase functions.

Our screen identified the orphan lysosomal transmembrane protein SPNS1, whose loss leads to neurodegeneration-like disease in animal models, as critical for cell survival under free choline limitation. We find that SPNS1 loss leads to massive accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) within the lysosome. Mechanistically, we revealed that SPNS1 is required for the efflux of LPC species from the lysosome to enable their reesterification into choline-containing phospholipids in the cytosol.

While p110 is critically involved in pathogenic vascular remodeling, its physiological role for vascular integrity under stress conditions has not been studied. We report a protective function of smooth muscle p110 against abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation.\n\nMethods & ResultsIn mice lacking p110 in smooth muscle cells (sm-p110-/-), perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) yielded substantially enhanced AAA formation compared to wild type controls. This disease phenotype is partly attributable to a subtle preexisting vascular phenotype under basal conditions, as sm-p110-/- mice displayed a smaller media area, deranged aortic wall structure (detached smooth muscle cells, increased apoptotic cell death), and a diminished functional responsiveness of aortic rings to vasodilators. Furthermore, p110 is also implicated in regenerative processes during AAA development: Whereas wild type mice showed increased media hypertrophy, neointima formation and proliferation upon PPE intervention, these vascular remodeling processes were diminished in sm-p110-/- mice. Concomitantly, increased numbers of elastic fiber breaks and ECM degradation were detected in sm-p110-/- aorta. Mechanistically, we found that lack of p110 expression impaired smooth muscle cell proliferation, expression of contractile marker genes and production of elastin fibers. This phenotype largely depended on reduced phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO1, as specific FOXO1 inhibition fully rescued proliferation of p110-/- smooth muscle cells, and knockdown of FOXO1 increased expression of calponin and elastin.\n\nConclusionsSmooth muscle p110 protects against AAA disease by maintaining aortic wall homoeostasis and promoting SMC proliferation to compensate for cell loss during AAA development.

Using the Hayflick model of human cell replicative aging, we performed a Perturb-seq screen of 200 transcription factors (TFs) selected through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and literature search. We identified dozens of potentially rejuvenating TFs--those that when overexpressed or repressed in late passage cells reprogrammed global gene expression patterns back to an earlier passage state. We further validated four top TF perturbations through molecular phenotyping of various aging hallmarks. Late passage cells either overexpressing EZH2 or E2F3 or repressing STAT3 or ZFX had more cell division, less senescence, improved proteostasis, and enhanced mitochondrial function. These TF perturbations led to similar downstream gene expression programs. In addition, the rejuvenating effects of these TFs were independent of telomeres. We believe our general approach for identifying rejuvenating factors can be applied to other model systems, and some of the top TF perturbations we discovered will lead to future research in novel, safer rejuvenation therapies."}, {"category": "biochemistry", "authors": "Eisenbeis, V.

As their biosynthesis depends on ATP concentration, PP-InsPs are tightly connected to cellular energy homeostasis. Consequently, an increasing number of studies involves PP-InsPs in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, aspects of tumorigenesis, and hyperphosphatemia. Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signalling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS. Using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that PP-InsP levels decrease upon exposure to oxidative stressors in HCT116 cells. Application of quinone drugs, particularly {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that {beta}-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are oxygen dependent. Experiments in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells deficient of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) demonstrated that {beta}-lap requires NQO1-bioactivation to regulate the cellular metabolism of PP-InsPs. Critically, significant reductions in cellular ATP concentrations were not directly mirrored in reduced PP-InsP levels as shown in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells treated with {beta}-lap. The data presented here unveil new aspects of {beta}-lap pharmacology and its impact on PP-InsP levels. Our identification of different quinone drugs as modulators of PP-InsP synthesis will allow to better appreciate their overall impact on cellular function.\n\n2 Significance StatementInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are messenger molecules regulating various functions in mammals. They are associated with the oxidative stress response, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigate PP-InsP signalling in mammalian cells subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Applying the quinone {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap) generated intracellular ROS resulting in decreased PP-InsP levels. This indicates a key role of PP-InsPs in cellular signalling under oxidative stress. Moreover, {beta}-lap mediated PP-InsP signalling required oxygen and the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). Since quinone drugs are cytotoxic, our data provide a basis for further investigations into the role of PP-InsPs during quinone-dependent chemotherapies. This is of special relevance since a phase II clinical trial demonstrated {beta}-lap efficacy in a combination chemotherapy against pancreatic cancer."}, {"category": "cell biology", "authors": "Braun, H.; Xu, Z.; Chang, F.; Viceconte, N.; Rane, G.; Levin, M.; Lototska, L.; Roth, F.; Hillairet, A.; Fradera-Sola, A.; Khanchandani, V.; Dreesen, O.; Yang, Y.; Shi, Y.; Li, F.; Butter, F.; Kappei, D.", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Science and Technology of China", "author_corresponding": "Fudong Li", "doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518500", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/01/2022.11.30.518500", "title": "ZNF524 directly interacts with telomeric DNA and supports telomere integrity", "date": "2022-12-01", "relevance": "2 Probably Irrelevant", "abstract": "Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of linear chromosomes.

However, both reintroductions and recolonisations can give rise to population bottlenecks that reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding, potentially causing accumulation of genetic load and reduced fitness. Most current populations of the endemic high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) originate from recent reintroductions or recolonisations following regional extirpations due to past overharvesting. We investigated and compared the genomic consequences of these two paths to reestablishment using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 100 Svalbard reindeer across their range. We found little admixture between reintroduced and natural populations. Two reintroduced populations, each founded by 12 individuals around four decades (i.e. 8 reindeer generations) ago, formed two distinct genetic clusters. Compared to the source population, these populations showed only small decreases in genome-wide heterozygosity and increases in inbreeding and lengths of runs of homozygosity. In contrast, the two naturally recolonised populations without admixture possessed much lower heterozygosity, higher inbreeding, and longer runs of homozygosity, possibly caused by serial population bottlenecks and/or fewer or more genetically related founders than in the reintroduction events. Naturally recolonised populations can thus be more vulnerable to the accumulation of genetic load than reintroduced populations. This suggests that in some organisms even small-scale reintroduction programs based on genetically diverse source populations can be more effective than natural recolonisation in establishing genetically diverse populations.

Therefore, we hypothesized that bmp6 could be used to generate new cyprinid strains without IMBs by gene editing. In this study, we established a gene editing strategy for knocking out the two orthologs of bmp6 in diploid crucian carp (Carassius auratus). We obtained an F3 population with both orthologs knocked out, in which no IMBs were detected by bone staining and X-ray, indicating that the new strain without IMBs (named WUCI strain) was successfully generated. Furthermore, we extensively evaluated the performance of the new strain in growth, reproduction, nutrient components, muscle texture and structure, and metabolites in muscle. The results showed that the WUCI strain grew faster than the wild-type crucian carp at 4-month-age. The reproductive performance and flesh quality did not show significant differences between the WUCI strain and wild-type crucian carp. Moreover, the metabolomics analysis suggested that the muscle tissues of the WUCI strain significantly enriched some metabolites belonging to the Thiamine metabolism, Nicotinate and Nicotinamide Metabolism pathway, which plays beneficial effects in anti-aging, antioxidant, and anti-radiation damage. In conclusion, we established a strategy to eliminate IMBs in crucian carp and obtain a WUCI strain whose performance was expected compared to the wild-type crucian carp; meanwhile, the WUCI strain enriched some beneficial metabolites to human health in muscle tissue.

For the structurally more complex protein FUS the role of the low complexity (LC) domain in LLPS has been intensively studied. Apart from the LC domain we here investigate theoretically two IDRs, one near the N-terminus and another near the C-terminus.

In contrast to most other lanthipeptide synthetases, ProcM, a class II lanthipeptide synthetase, demonstrates high substrate tolerance. It is enigmatic that a single enzyme can catalyze the cyclization process of a diverse range of substrates with high fidelity. Previous studies suggested that the site-selectivity of lanthionine formation is determined by substrate sequence rather than by the enzyme. However, exactly how substrate sequence contributes to site-selective lanthipeptide biosynthesis is not clear. In this study, we performed molecular dynamic simulations for ProcA3.3 core peptide variants to explore how the predicted solution structure of the substrate without enzyme correlates to final product formation. Our simulation results support a model in which the secondary structure of the core peptide controls the ring pattern of the final product. We also demonstrate that the dehydration step in the biosynthesis pathway does not influence the site-selectivity of ring formation. In addition, we performed simulation for the core peptides of ProcA1.1 and 2.8, which are well-suited candidates to investigate the connection between order of ring formation and solution structure. Simulation results indicate that in both cases, C-terminal ring formation is more likely which was supported by experimental results. Our findings indicate that the substrate sequence and its solution structure can be used to predict the site-selectivity and order of ring formation, and that secondary structure is a crucial factor influencing the site-selectivity.

Here we show that speed trajectories and durations of human walking bouts are explained better by an objective to minimize Energy and Time, meaning the total work or energy to reach destination, plus a cost proportional to bout duration. Applied to a computational model of walking dynamics, this objective predicts dynamic speed vs. time trajectories with inverted U shapes. Model and human experiment (N = 10) show that shorter bouts are unsteady and dominated by the time and effort of accelerating, and longer ones are steadier and faster due to energy-per-distance. Individual-dependent vigor may be characterized by the energy one is willing to spend to save a unit of time, which explains why some may walk faster than others, but everyone may have similar-shaped trajectories due to similar walking dynamics.

While there are many tools available to induce these systems, nature has provided other mechanisms that can be utilized to expand the split protein toolbox.

As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In this study, we present the \"multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test\" (mvMAPIT) -- a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact -- thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search-based methods. Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate mvMAPIT as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized GWA studies. With simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvMAPIT over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies.

We used a yeast-adapted destabilizing domain degron, which can be stabilized by estradiol addition (ERdd). Leveraging the yeast GFP collection and lab automation platforms, we ERdd-tagged 775 essential genes and screened for strains with estradiol dependent growth. Three genes, SPC110, DIS3 and RRP46, were found to be particularly suitable. Respective strains showed no growth defect in the presence of estradiol and strong growth inhibition in its absence. Of these, SPC110-ERdd offered the most stringent containment, with an escape frequency of 7.0x10-8, and full growth restoration at 100 nM estradiol. By systematically analysing the containment escapees, we identified the non-essential C-terminal region of SPC110 as target for escape mutations. Its removal decreased the escape frequency with a single ERdd tag further to 4.3x10-9. Combining SPC110-ERdd with a second ERdd tag on either DIS3 or RRP46 resulted in escape frequencies below the detection limit of the used assay (<2x10-10). Being based on conditional protein stability, this approach is mechanistically orthogonal to previously reported intrinsic biocontainment systems.

Their name derives from their ability to  insulate transgenes from genomic position effects, an important function in gene therapy and biotechnology applications that require high levels of sustained transgene expression. In theory, flanking transgenes with insulators protects them from position effects, but in practice, efforts to insulate transgenes meet with mixed success because the contextual requirements for insulator function in the genome are not well understood. A key question is whether insulators are modular elements that can function anywhere in the genome or whether they are adapted to function only in certain genomic locations. To distinguish between these two possibilities we developed MPIRE (Massively Parallel Integrated Regulatory Elements) and used it to measure the effects of three insulators (A2, cHS4, ALOXE3) and their mutants at thousands of locations across the genome. Our results show that each insulator functions in only a small number of genomic locations, and that insulator function depends on the sequence motifs that comprise each insulator. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but specificity arises because each insulator blocks enhancers that are bound by different sets of transcription factors. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but only ALOXE3 can act as a heterochromatin barrier.

We have previously found that YTHDF1 regulates depolarization-induced protein synthesis by promoting translation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified transcripts5.

Phosphorylation of FMRP serine 499 induced by neuronal depolarization alters the condensing behavior of prion-like protein YTHDF1. Unphosphorylated FMRP sequesters YTHDF1 away from the translation initiation complex, whereas the stimulation-induced FMRP phosphorylation releases YTHDF1 to form translational active condensates with the ribosome to activate translation of YTHDF1 target transcripts. In fragile X syndrome (FXS) models characterized by low FMRP expression, we observed YTHDF1-mediated hyperactive translation, which notably impacts FXS pathophysiology. Developmental defects in an FXS forebrain organoid model could be reversed by a selective small-molecule inhibitor of YTHDF1 which acts by suppressing its condensation in neurons. We characterized transcriptome-wide mRNA translation with inhibitor treatment in organoids and identified targets that explain alleviated FXS pathology. Our study thus reveals FMRP and its phosphorylation as an important regulator of the activity-dependent translation during neuronal development and stimulation, and identifies YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target for FXS in which developmental defects caused by FMRP depletion could be reversed through YTHDF1 inhibition."}, {"category": "synthetic biology", "authors": "Bozhueyuek, K.

It was previously reported that knockout of Ku80 in a human cell line results in lethality, but the underlying cause of Ku essentiality in human cells has yet to be fully explored. Here, we established conditional Ku70 knockout cells to study the essentiality of Ku70 function. Endogenous Ku70 knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in cells where Ku70 expression was maintained through integration of an HA-tagged Ku70 cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Ku70 conditional knockout cell lines were identified via western blotting, and edits were validated by Sanger sequencing. We visually observed cell death in Ku70 knockout cells 8-10 days post Ku70-HA depletion, and loss of viability following Ku depletion was quantified using crystal violet assays. Interestingly, assessment of telomere length in Ku70 knockout cells using telomere restriction fragment analyses did not reveal any changes in average telomere length following Ku70-HA depletion. Immunofluorescence analysis used to assess {gamma}H2AX foci accumulation as a measure of double-stranded DNA breaks following Ku70-HA depletion allowed us to conclude that increased DNA damage is not the driving cause of loss of cell viability. Finally, quantitative proteome analysis of Ku70 knockout cells following Ku70-HA depletion identified a number of pathways and proteins that are significantly dysregulated following the loss of Ku70, including processes which Ku function has been previously associated with such as cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this conditional Ku70 knockout system reveals that loss of Ku affects multiple cellular processes and pathways and suggests that Ku plays critical roles in other cellular processes beyond DNA repair and telomere maintenance to maintain cell viability.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Ku70/80 heterodimer is a key player in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, where it acts as a scaffold for other repair factors needed to process double-stranded DNA breaks. Ku has also been involved in other cellular functions like telomere regulation and maintenance, in which Kus role is not fully characterized. Previous data suggest that while loss of Ku70/80 can be tolerated in other species, Ku is essential to humans. We have established a conditional Ku70 knockout in HEK293 cells to evaluate the basis of Ku essentiality in human cells. While we observed loss of cell viability upon Ku depletion, we did not observe significant changes in telomere length nor did we record lethal levels of DNA damage upon loss of Ku, suggesting that the reasons for the loss of viability is not linked to the functions of Ku in DNA repair or at telomeres. Analysis of global proteome changes following Ku70 depletion revealed dysregulations of several cellular pathways including cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis. Our study reveals that loss of Ku affects multiple cellular processes and pathways and suggests that Ku plays critical roles in cellular processes beyond DNA repair and telomere maintenance to maintain cell viability."}, {"category": "biochemistry", "authors": "Ghimire, J.; Hart, R.

Herein, we used fluorescence polarization assays and observed direct transfer for several well-characterized nucleic acid-binding proteins: three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, Fem-3-binding factor 2, and MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. For TREX1, the direct transfer mechanism was additionally interrogated by single molecule assays, and the data suggest that direct transfer occurs through an unstable ternary intermediate with partially associated ligands. Generally, direct transfer could allow many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins to conduct a one-dimensional search for their target sites. Furthermore, presumably long-lived protein-polynucleotide complexes might instead be readily replaced by other protein-polynucleotide complexes in vivo.\n\nSignificanceClassically, the lifetime of a protein-ligand complex is presumed to be an intrinsic property, unaffected by competitor molecules in free solution. By contrast, a few oligomeric nucleic acid binding proteins have been observed to exchange competing ligands in their binding sites, and consequently their lifetimes decrease with competitor concentration. Our findings indicate that this \"direct transfer\" is a more general property of nucleic acid binding proteins. This suggests that many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins can reduce the dimensionality of their search for their target sites by intramolecular direct transfer to nucleosome DNA, instead of relying entirely on three-dimensional diffusion, and it suggests that their mean complex lifetimes in vivo can be regulated by the concentration of free ligand molecules."}, {"category": "molecular biology", "authors": "Tsirigotaki, A.; Dansercoer, A.; Verschueren, K.

In this study, we primarily examine the essential hub protein LC8, a small dimer that binds disordered regions of 100+ client proteins in two symmetrical grooves at the dimer interface. Mechanistic details of LC8 binding have remained elusive, hampered in part by ITC data analyses employing simple models that treat bivalent binding as a single event with a single binding affinity. We build on existing Bayesian ITC approaches to quantify thermodynamic parameters for multi-site binding interactions impacted by significant uncertainty in protein concentration. Using a two-site binding model, we model LC8 binding and identify positive cooperativity with high confidence for multiple client peptides. Application of an identical model to two-site binding between the coiled-coil dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein reveals little evidence of cooperativity, in contrast to LC8. We propose that cooperativity in the LC8 system drives the formation of saturated 2:2 bound states, which play a functional role in many LC8 complexes. In addition to these system-specific findings, our work advances general ITC analysis in two ways. First, we describe a previously unrecognized mathematical ambiguity in concentrations in standard binding models and clarify how it impacts the precision with which binding parameters can be determined in cases of high uncertainty in analyte concentrations. Second, building on observations in the LC8 system, we develop a system-agnostic heat map of practical parameter identifiability calculated from synthetic data which demonstrates that certain binding parameters intrinsically inflate parameter uncertainty in ITC analysis, independent of experimental uncertainties.\n\nAuthor SummaryMulti-site protein-protein interactions govern many protein functions throughout the cell. Precise determination of thermodynamic constants of multi-site binding is a significant biophysical challenge, however. The application of complex models to multi-step interactions is difficult and hampered further by complications arising from uncertainty in analyte concentrations. To address these issues, we utilize Bayesian statistical techniques which calculate the  likelihood of parameters giving rise to experimental observations to build probability density distributions for thermodynamic parameters of binding. To demonstrate the method and improve our understanding how the hub protein LC8 promotes dimerization of its 100+ binding partners, we test the pipeline on several of these partners and demonstrate that LC8 can bind clients cooperatively, driving interactions towards a  fully bound functional state. We additionally examine an interaction between the dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein, which does not appear to bind with cooperativity. Our work provides a solid foundation for future analysis of more complicated binding interactions, including oligomeric complexes formed between LC8 and clients with multiple LC8-binding sites."}, {"category": "biochemistry", "authors": "Boschi, C.; Scheim, D.

ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a major role in the diversification of the Kruppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily, which predominates in tetrapod genomes. At present, it is unknown whether this function and co-evolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs, or a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver in the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from more than 4000 animal genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution, both within and between major taxonomic groups. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in a diverse set of representative animal species. We further investigate one of the most expansive ZNF subfamilies found in cyprinid fish, which are characterized by a conserved domain we dubbed the Fish N-terminal Zinc-finger associated (FiNZ) domain. FiNZ-ZNFs have dramatically expanded in several fish species, including the zebrafish in which we predict ~700 FiNZ-ZNF genes. Almost all are located on the long arm of chromosome 4, and recent duplicates are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, the bulk of zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed in waves at the onset of zygotic genome activation. Blocking FiNZ-ZNF translation using morpholinos during early zebrafish embryogenesis results in a global de-repression of young, transcriptionally active TEs, likely driven by the failure to establish heterochromatin over these elements. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution and that families of ZNFs have been deployed independently in fish and mammals to repress TEs during early embryogenesis."}, {"category": "biochemistry", "authors": "Zimmermann, L.-M.

We show that biochemical mechanisms employed by these two species to survive desiccation and freezing under laboratory conditions are similar.

In this study we address these shortcomings by building a novel mutation-aware modelling framework of cell growth in a turbidostat.

We assessed the binding of either wild-type CaM, or mutant CaM with one or more defective EF-hand domains, to FR.

A similar trend was observed with normal KTB-21 cells. Our results showed that the collagen curvature was the dominating factor on this enhanced motility and stretching the matrices to equalize the collagen fiber linearity of the matrices ameliorated the observed increase in cell migration and invasion in the mice that were exposed to a high-fat diet. Previous studies indicated an increase in serum leptin concentration for those children born to an obese mother. We generated extracellular matrices using primary fibroblasts exposed to various concentrations of leptin. This produced curvier ECM and increased breast cancer cell motility for cells seeded on the decellularized ECM generated with increasing leptin concentration.
