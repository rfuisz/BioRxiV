We curated lipid measurements for 37,754 All of Us participants with whole genome sequence (WGS) data and 190,982 UK Biobank participants with whole exome sequence (WES) data.

To characterize the advantages and drawbacks of different TRE attributes in facilitating cross-cohort analysis, we conducted a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of standard lipid measures on the UKB RAP and AoU RW using two approaches: meta-analysis and pooled analysis. We curated lipid measurements for 37,754 All of Us participants with whole genome sequence (WGS) data and 190,982 UK Biobank participants with whole exome sequence (WES) data. For the meta-analysis, we performed a GWAS of each cohort in their respective platform and meta-analyzed the results. We separately performed a pooled GWAS on both datasets combined. We identified 454 and 445 significant variants in meta-analysis and pooled analysis, respectively. Comparison of full summary data from both meta-analysis and pooled analysis with an external study showed strong correlation of known loci with lipid levels (R2~91-98%).

While p110 is critically involved in pathogenic vascular remodeling, its physiological role for vascular integrity under stress conditions has not been studied. We report a protective function of smooth muscle p110 against abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation.

Methods & ResultsIn mice lacking p110 in smooth muscle cells (sm-p110-/-), perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) yielded substantially enhanced AAA formation compared to wild type controls. This disease phenotype is partly attributable to a subtle preexisting vascular phenotype under basal conditions, as sm-p110-/- mice displayed a smaller media area, deranged aortic wall structure (detached smooth muscle cells, increased apoptotic cell death), and a diminished functional responsiveness of aortic rings to vasodilators. Furthermore, p110 is also implicated in regenerative processes during AAA development: Whereas wild type mice showed increased media hypertrophy, neointima formation and proliferation upon PPE intervention, these vascular remodeling processes were diminished in sm-p110-/- mice. Concomitantly, increased numbers of elastic fiber breaks and ECM degradation were detected in sm-p110-/- aorta. Mechanistically, we found that lack of p110 expression impaired smooth muscle cell proliferation, expression of contractile marker genes and production of elastin fibers. This phenotype largely depended on reduced phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO1, as specific FOXO1 inhibition fully rescued proliferation of p110-/- smooth muscle cells, and knockdown of FOXO1 increased expression of calponin and elastin.

ConclusionsSmooth muscle p110 protects against AAA disease by maintaining aortic wall homoeostasis and promoting SMC proliferation to compensate for cell loss during AAA development.

Despite numerous options to tackle hypertrophic scarring, efficient therapies are still scarce, and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Secreted factors from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) were previously described for their beneficial effects in tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the effects of PBMCsec on skin scarring in mouse models and human scar explant cultures at single cell resolution (scRNAseq).

MethodsMouse wounds and scars were treated with PBMCsec either intradermally or topically. Human mature scars were treated with PBMCsec ex vivo in explant cultures. All experimental settings were analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). A variety of bioinformatics approaches were used to decipher gene regulation in the scRNAseq data sets. Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were investigated in situ by immunofluorescence. The effect of PBMCsec on myofibroblast differentiation and elastin expression was investigated by stimulating human primary fibroblasts with TGF{beta}.

FindingsTopical and intradermal application of PBMCsec regulated the expression of a variety of genes involved in pro-fibrotic processes and tissue remodeling. Our bioinformatics approach identified elastin as a common linchpin of antifibrotic action in both, the mouse and human experimental setting. In vitro, we found that PBMCsec prevents TGF{beta}-mediated myofibroblast-differentiation and attenuates abundant elastin expression through non-canonical signaling inhibition. Furthermore, TGF{beta}-induced breakdown of elastic fibers was strongly inhibited by addition of PBMCsec.

Activation of the wild-type ACVR1 kinase requires assembly of a tetrameric type I and II BMP receptor complex followed by phosphorylation of the ACVR1 GS domain by type II BMP receptors. Previous studies showed that the FOP mutant ACVR1-R206H requires type II BMP receptors and presumptive GS domain phosphorylation for over-active signaling. Structural modeling of the FOP-ACVR1 mutant kinase domain supports that FOP mutations alter the conformation of the GS domain, but it is unclear how this leads to overactive signaling.

Earlier, four candidate genes for Rph7 were reported and, despite an in-depth comparative sequence analysis and haplotypic characterisation, the causal gene could not be resolved. Here, we successfully cloned Rph7 utilising a fine mapping approach in combination with an RNA-Seq based expression analysis. We identified three up-regulated and pathogen-induced genes with presence/absence variation (PAV) at this locus. Sequence analysis of chemically induced Rph7 knockout mutant lines identified multiple independent non-synonymous variants, including a premature stop codon in a single non-canonical resistance gene that encodes a 302-amino acid protein. Progeny from four independent transgenic lines segregated for the expected avirulent Rph7 infection type in response to several avirulent P. hordei pathotypes, however, all plants were susceptible to a single virulent pathotype confirming the specificity.

The barley leaf rust resistance locus Rph7, located on the short arm of chromosome 3H, confers defence at all growth stages and was previously shown to have unusually high sequence and haplotype divergence. Earlier, four candidate genes for Rph7 were reported and, despite an in-depth comparative sequence analysis and haplotypic characterisation, the causal gene could not be resolved. Here, we successfully cloned Rph7 utilising a fine mapping approach in combination with an RNA-Seq based expression analysis. We identified three up-regulated and pathogen-induced genes with presence/absence variation (PAV) at this locus. Sequence analysis of chemically induced Rph7 knockout mutant lines identified multiple independent non-synonymous variants, including a premature stop codon in a single non-canonical resistance gene that encodes a 302-amino acid protein. Progeny from four independent transgenic lines segregated for the expected avirulent Rph7 infection type in response to several avirulent P. hordei pathotypes, however, all plants were susceptible to a single virulent pathotype confirming the specificity. Structural analysis using an AlphaFold2 protein model suggests that Rph7 encodes a putative NAC transcription factor, as it shares structural similarity to ANAC019 from Arabidopsis, with a C-terminal BED domain.

M.; Crawford, L.",Lorin Crawford,Microsoft Research New England,4 Very Relevant,2022-12-01,genetics,"Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic loci, is known to play an important role in the phenotypic variation of complex traits. As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In this study, we present the ""multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test"" (mvMAPIT) -- a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact -- thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search-based methods. Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate mvMAPIT as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized GWA studies. With simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvMAPIT over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies.

ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a major role in the diversification of the Kruppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily, which predominates in tetrapod genomes. At present, it is unknown whether this function and co-evolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs, or a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver in the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from more than 4000 animal genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution, both within and between major taxonomic groups. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in a diverse set of representative animal species. We further investigate one of the most expansive ZNF subfamilies found in cyprinid fish, which are characterized by a conserved domain we dubbed the Fish N-terminal Zinc-finger associated (FiNZ) domain.

It was previously reported that knockout of Ku80 in a human cell line results in lethality, but the underlying cause of Ku essentiality in human cells has yet to be fully explored. Here, we established conditional Ku70 knockout cells to study the essentiality of Ku70 function. Endogenous Ku70 knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in cells where Ku70 expression was maintained through integration of an HA-tagged Ku70 cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Ku70 conditional knockout cell lines were identified via western blotting, and edits were validated by Sanger sequencing. We visually observed cell death in Ku70 knockout cells 8-10 days post Ku70-HA depletion, and loss of viability following Ku depletion was quantified using crystal violet assays. Interestingly, assessment of telomere length in Ku70 knockout cells using telomere restriction fragment analyses did not reveal any changes in average telomere length following Ku70-HA depletion. Immunofluorescence analysis used to assess {gamma}H2AX foci accumulation as a measure of double-stranded DNA breaks following Ku70-HA depletion allowed us to conclude that increased DNA damage is not the driving cause of loss of cell viability. Finally, quantitative proteome analysis of Ku70 knockout cells following Ku70-HA depletion identified a number of pathways and proteins that are significantly dysregulated following the loss of Ku70, including processes which Ku function has been previously associated with such as cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis.

Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signalling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS.

K.",Jae Kyoung Kim,"Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST",2 Probably Irrelevant,2022-11-27,bioinformatics,"MotivationCell function is regulated by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) defined by protein-mediated interaction between constituent genes. Despite advances in experimental techniques, we can still measure only a fraction of the processes that govern GRN dynamics. To infer the properties of GRNs using partial observation, unobserved sequential processes can be replaced with distributed time delays, yielding non-Markovian models. Inference methods based on the resulting model suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

ResultsWe develop a simulation-based Bayesian MCMC method for the efficient and accurate inference of GRN parameters when only some of their products are observed. We illustrate our approach using a two-step activation model: An activation signal leads to the accumulation of an unobserved regulatory protein, which triggers the expression of observed fluorescent proteins. With prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein. We can estimate the delay and kinetic parameters characterizing target regulation including transcription, translation, and target searching of an unobserved protein from experimental measurements of the products of its target gene. Our method is scalable and can be used to analyze non-Markovian models with hidden components.

J.; Cheng, Y.-Y.; Kim, H. J.; Choi, B.; Josic, K.; Kim, J. K.; Corresponding Author: Jae Kyoung Kim; Author Institution: Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST; Category: bioinformatics; Abstract: MotivationCell function is regulated by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) defined by protein-mediated interaction between constituent genes. Despite advances in experimental techniques, we can still measure only a fraction of the processes that govern GRN dynamics. To infer the properties of GRNs using partial observation, unobserved sequential processes can be replaced with distributed time delays, yielding non-Markovian models. Inference methods based on the resulting model suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

ResultsWe develop a simulation-based Bayesian MCMC method for the efficient and accurate inference of GRN parameters when only some of their products are observed. We illustrate our approach using a two-step activation model: An activation signal leads to the accumulation of an unobserved regulatory protein, which triggers the expression of observed fluorescent proteins. With prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein. We can estimate the delay and kinetic parameters characterizing target regulation including transcription, translation, and target searching of an unobserved protein from experimental measurements of the products of its target gene. Our method is scalable and can be used to analyze non-Markovian models with hidden components.

Genotyping by sequencing is progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping by sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% of which consists of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (unique regions). We designed a custom set of 566,722 gRNAs, each with at least 25 recognition sites, targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats in 500-bp insert sequencing libraries. We excluded repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data.

Genotyping by sequencing is progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping by sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% of which consists of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (unique regions). We designed a custom set of 566,722 gRNAs, each with at least 25 recognition sites, targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats in 500-bp insert sequencing libraries. We excluded repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed 40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to unique and functional regions by 2.6-fold.

M.",Daniel M Zuckerman,Oregon Health & Science University,3 Possibly Relevant,2022-11-28,biophysics,"Multistep protein-protein interactions underlie most biological processes, but their characterization through methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is largely confined to simple models that provide little information on the intermediate, individual steps. In this study, we primarily examine the essential hub protein LC8, a small dimer that binds disordered regions of 100+ client proteins in two symmetrical grooves at the dimer interface. Mechanistic details of LC8 binding have remained elusive, hampered in part by ITC data analyses employing simple models that treat bivalent binding as a single event with a single binding affinity. We build on existing Bayesian ITC approaches to quantify thermodynamic parameters for multi-site binding interactions impacted by significant uncertainty in protein concentration. Using a two-site binding model, we model LC8 binding and identify positive cooperativity with high confidence for multiple client peptides. Application of an identical model to two-site binding between the coiled-coil dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein reveals little evidence of cooperativity, in contrast to LC8. We propose that cooperativity in the LC8 system drives the formation of saturated 2:2 bound states, which play a functional role in many LC8 complexes. In addition to these system-specific findings, our work advances general ITC analysis in two ways. First, we describe a previously unrecognized mathematical ambiguity in concentrations in standard binding models and clarify how it impacts the precision with which binding parameters can be determined in cases of high uncertainty in analyte concentrations. Second, building on observations in the LC8 system, we develop a system-agnostic heat map of practical parameter identifiability calculated from synthetic data which demonstrates that certain binding parameters intrinsically inflate parameter uncertainty in ITC analysis, independent of experimental uncertainties.

Author SummaryMulti-site protein-protein interactions govern many protein functions throughout the cell.

B.; George, A.; Barbar, E.; Zuckerman, D. M.; Corresponding Author: Daniel M Zuckerman; Author Institution: Oregon Health & Science University; Category: biophysics; Abstract: Multistep protein-protein interactions underlie most biological processes, but their characterization through methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is largely confined to simple models that provide little information on the intermediate, individual steps. In this study, we primarily examine the essential hub protein LC8, a small dimer that binds disordered regions of 100+ client proteins in two symmetrical grooves at the dimer interface. Mechanistic details of LC8 binding have remained elusive, hampered in part by ITC data analyses employing simple models that treat bivalent binding as a single event with a single binding affinity. We build on existing Bayesian ITC approaches to quantify thermodynamic parameters for multi-site binding interactions impacted by significant uncertainty in protein concentration. Using a two-site binding model, we model LC8 binding and identify positive cooperativity with high confidence for multiple client peptides. Application of an identical model to two-site binding between the coiled-coil dimer NudE and the intermediate chain of dynein reveals little evidence of cooperativity, in contrast to LC8. We propose that cooperativity in the LC8 system drives the formation of saturated 2:2 bound states, which play a functional role in many LC8 complexes. In addition to these system-specific findings, our work advances general ITC analysis in two ways. First, we describe a previously unrecognized mathematical ambiguity in concentrations in standard binding models and clarify how it impacts the precision with which binding parameters can be determined in cases of high uncertainty in analyte concentrations. Second, building on observations in the LC8 system, we develop a system-agnostic heat map of practical parameter identifiability calculated from synthetic data which demonstrates that certain binding parameters intrinsically inflate parameter uncertainty in ITC analysis, independent of experimental uncertainties.

Author SummaryMulti-site protein-protein interactions govern many protein functions throughout the cell. Precise determination of thermodynamic constants of multi-site binding is a significant biophysical challenge, however.
