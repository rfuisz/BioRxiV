Botrylloides diegensis is an ascidian that has been misidentified in previous studies and is recorded in GenBank as Botrylloides leachii due to the high morphological similarity between the sister species. More available sequences and strategies around identification would help resolve some of the confusion currently surrounding its ambiguous nature. We collected several Botrylloides samples from 7 locations around New Zealand - Dunedin, Christchurch, Picton, Nelson, Whangateau, New Plymouth and Invercargill - and barcoded the species based on Cytochrome Oxidase I, Histone 3, 18S, and 28S ribosomal RNA markers.

However, developing extensions of chaining algorithms for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been challenging. Recently, a new sparse dynamic programming framework was introduced that exploits small path cover of pangenome reference DAGs, and enables efficient chaining [Makinen et al. TALG19, RECOMB18]. However, the underlying problem formulation did not consider gap cost which makes chaining less effective in practice. To address this, we develop novel problem formulations and optimal chaining algorithms that support a variety of gap cost functions. We demonstrate empirically the ability of our provably-good chaining implementation to align long reads more precisely in comparison to existing aligners. For mapping simulated long reads from human genome to a pangenome DAG of 95 human haplotypes, we achieve 98.7% precision while leaving < 2% reads unmapped.\n\nImplementationhttps://github.com/at-cg/minichain", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2022.08.29.505691", "predicted_relevance": 2.73}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.10.519922", "title": "Regulation of Nuclear Transcription by Mitochondrial RNA", "authors": "Sriram, K.; Qi, Z.; Yuan, D.; Malhi, N.

In human endothelial cells (ECs), the level of mt-caRNA-promoter attachment changes in response to environmental stress that mimics diabetes.

C. elegans development is characterized by five morphologically distinct stages, including four larval stages and the adult stage. Stages differ in a variety of aspects including size, gene expression, physiology, and behavior. Enrichment for a particular developmental stage is often the first step in experimental design. When many hundreds of worms are required, the standard methods of enrichment are to grow a synchronized population of hatchlings for a fixed time, or to sort a mixed population of worms according to size. Current size-sorting methods have higher throughput than synchronization and avoid its use of harsh chemicals. However, these size-sorting methods currently require expensive instrumentation or custom microfluidic devices, both of which are unavailable to the majority C. elegans laboratories. Accordingly, there is a need for inexpensive, accessible sorting strategies. We investigated the use of low-cost, commercially available cell strainers to filter C. elegans by size. We found that the probability of recovery after filtration as a function of body size for cell strainers of three different mesh sizes is well described by logistic functions. Application of these functions to predict filtration outcomes revealed non-ideal properties of filtration of worms by cell strainers that nevertheless enhanced filtration outcomes. Further, we found that serial filtration using a pair of strainers that have different mesh sizes can be used to enrich for particular larval stages with a purity close to that of synchronization, the most widely used enrichment method. Throughput of the cell strainer method, up to 14,000 worms per minute, greatly exceeds that of other enrichment methods. We conclude that size sorting by cell strainers is a useful addition to the array of existing methods for enrichment of particular developmental stages in C. elegans.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.07.523116", "predicted_relevance": 2.03}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.06.522834", "title": "DNA methylation signature in NSD2 loss-of-function variants appeared similar to that in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome", "authors": "Kawai, T.; Kinoshita, S.; Takayama, Y.; Onishi, E.; Kamura, H.; Kojima, K.; Kikuchi, H.; Terao, M.; Sugawara, T.; Migita, O.; Kagami, M.; Isojima, T.; Yamaguchi, Y.; Wakui, K.; Ohashi, H.; Shimizu, K.; Mizuno, S.; Okamoto, N.; Fukushima, Y.; Takada, F.; Kosaki, K.; Takada, S.; Akutsu, H.; Ura, K.; Nakabayashi, K.; Hata, K.", "author_corresponding": "Kenichiro Hata", "author_corresponding_institution": "Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "PurposeWolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), a contiguous gene syndrome caused by the hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 4 where NSD2 is, reportedly exhibits specific DNA methylation signatures in peripheral blood cells.

Misrepresenting these relationships may lead to the erroneous prediction of e.g. disease spread, drug delivery, and nerve injury in the brain. However, understanding fluid-neuron interactions is an outstanding challenge because the behaviours of both phases are not only dynamic but also occur at an extremely small length scale (the width of flow channel is [~]100 nm), which cannot be captured by the state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Here, by explicitly simulating dynamics of the flow and axons at the microstructural level, we, for the first time, establish the link between micromechanical tissue response to the physical laws governing the macroscopic transport property of the brain white matter. We found that interactions between axons and the interstitial flow is very strong, thus playing an essential role in the brain fluid/mass transport. Furthermore, we proposed the first anisotropic pressure-dependent permeability tensor informed by microstructural dynamics for more accurate brain modelling at the macroscale, and analysed the effect of the variation of the microstructural parameters that influence such tensor.

Standard-of-care shunts are synthetic, which can lead to thrombosis, and much stiffer than the two host vessels, which can cause adverse mechanobiological responses. Moreover, the neonatal vasculature can undergo significant changes in size and structure over a short period, thus constraining the use of a non-growing synthetic shunt.

Comparisons include age-specific physiological conditions and simulated  surgical-like shunt conditions. Results suggest that the intact umbilical vein is a better choice as a shunt than the umbilical artery due to concerns with lumen closure and constriction related-intramural damage in the latter.

Experimental panel assay protocols are routinely used as a standard procedure to evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of a drug candidate to target kinase. However, current kinase panel assays are time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the panel assay protocols neither provide insights on binding sites nor allow experiments on mutated sequences or newly-characterized kinases. Existing virtual screening or docking simulation technologies require extensive computational resources, thus it is not practical to use them for the panel of kinases. With rapid advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies, a number of DTI tools have been developed over the years. However, these methods are yet to achieve prediction accuracies at the level of practical use. In addition, the performances of current DTI tools vary significantly depending on test sets. In this case, an ensemble model can be used to improve and stabilize DTI prediction accuracies.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose an ensemble model, EnsDTI-kinase, that integrates eight existing machine learning and deep learning models into a unified model deployed as a web-server. Upon submission of a compound SMILES string, potential target kinases are automatically predicted and evaluated on the web-server. Importantly, EnsDTI-kinase is a computational platform where newly developed DTI tools can be easily incorporated without modifying core components so that its DTI prediction quality can improve over time. Besides, many useful functionalities are provided on our platform for users to further investigate predicted DTI: it allows confidence experiments by changing the amino acid (AA) at a specific position in a kinase sequence, named in silico mutagenesis, to investigate the effect of AA changes in binding affinity; it predicts kinase sequential regions where the query compound likely binds to by slidingly masking the sequence of selected kinases so that confidence in the predicted binding sites can be evaluated. Our model was evaluated in three experimental settings using four independent datasets, and showed accuracy of 0.82 compared to the average accuracy of 0.69 from five deep learning methods on the ChEMBL dataset. It achieved average selectivity of 0.95 within kinase families such as TK, CAMK and STE. For 8 out of 17 recent drugs, our model successfully predicted their interactions with 404 proteins at average accuracy of 0.82.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/ensdti\n\nContactsunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.06.523052", "predicted_relevance": 2.85}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.07.523113", "title": "Viral and bacterial ecogenomics in globally expanding red snow blooms", "authors": "Barno, A.

INKILN expression was assessed in multiple in vitro and ex vivo models of VSMC phenotypic modulation and human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) samples. The transcriptional regulation of INKILN was determined through luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Both loss- and gain-of-function approaches and multiple RNA-protein and protein-protein interaction assays were utilized to uncover the role of INKILN in VSMC proinflammatory gene program and underlying mechanisms. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) transgenic (Tg) mice were utilized to study INKLIN expression and function in ligation injury-induced neointimal formation.\n\nResultsINKILN expression is downregulated in contractile VSMCs and induced by human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. INKILN is transcriptionally activated by the p65 pathway, partially through a predicted NF-{kappa}B site within its proximal promoter. INKILN activates the proinflammatory gene expression in cultured human VSMCs and ex vivo cultured vessels. Mechanistically, INKILN physically interacts with and stabilizes MKL1, a key activator of VSMC inflammation through the p65/NF-{kappa}B pathway. INKILN depletion blocks ILI{beta}-induced nuclear localization of both p65 and MKL1. Knockdown of INKILN abolishes the physical interaction between p65 and MKL1, and the luciferase activity of an NF-{kappa}B reporter. Further, INKILN knockdown enhances MKL1 ubiquitination, likely through the reduced physical interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP10.

Here we comprehensively analyze known and newly discovered distal appendage proteins (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2, FBF1, CEP89, KIZ, ANKRD26, PIDD1, LRRC45, NCS1, C3ORF14) for their precise localization, order of recruitment, and their roles in each step of cilia formation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we show that the order of the recruitment of the distal appendage proteins is highly interconnected and a more complex hierarchy. Our analysis highlights two protein modules, CEP83-SCLT1 and CEP164-TTBK2, as critical for structural assembly of distal appendages. Functional assay revealed that CEP89 selectively functions in RAB34+ ciliary vesicle recruitment, while deletion of the integral components, CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2, severely compromised all four steps of cilium formation. Collectively, our analyses provide a more comprehensive view of the organization and the function of the distal appendage, paving the way for molecular understanding of ciliary assembly.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.06.522944", "predicted_relevance": 1.9}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.06.523037", "title": "Myristoylated Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 captures the ciliary vesicle at distal appendages", "authors": "Kanie, T.; Ng, R.; Abbott, K.

In many cell types, formation of the cilium is initiated by recruitment of ciliary vesicles to the distal appendage of the mother centriole. However, the distal appendage mechanism that directly captures ciliary vesicles is yet to be identified. In an accompanying paper, we show that the distal appendage protein, CEP89, is important for thef ciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other steps of cilium formation (Tomoharu Kanie, Love, Fisher, Gustavsson, & Jackson, 2023). The lack of a membrane binding motif in CEP89 suggests that it may indirectly recruit ciliary vesicles via another binding partner. Here, we identify Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. NCS1 localizes to the position between CEP89 and a ciliary vesicle marker, RAB34, at the distal appendage. This localization was completely abolished in CEP89 knockouts, suggesting that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. Similarly to CEP89 knockouts, ciliary vesicle recruitment as well as subsequent cilium formation was perturbed in NCS1 knockout cells. The ability of NCS1 to recruit the ciliary vesicle is dependent on its myristoylation motif and NCS1 knockout cells expressing myristoylation defective mutant failed to rescue the vesicle recruitment defect despite localizing proper localization to the centriole. In sum, our analysis reveals the first known mechanism for how the distal appendage recruits the ciliary vesicles.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.06.523037", "predicted_relevance": 1.83}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.07.523106", "title": "A humanized Caenorhabditis elegans model of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia-associated variants in kinesin light chain KLC4", "authors": "Gumusderelioglu, S.; Resch, L.; Brock, T.; Undiagnosed Diseases Network,  ; Luxton, G.

Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated its effects on bone tissue, which were also notably predicted in the mechanostat theory. Indeed, existing methods to quantify bone mechanoregulation have successfully associated the frequency of remodeling events with local mechanical signals, combining time-lapsed in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging and micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis. However, a correlation between the local surface velocity of remodeling events and mechanical signals has not been shown. As many degenerative bone diseases have also been linked to impaired bone remodeling, this relationship could provide an advantage in detecting the effects of such conditions and advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel method to estimate remodeling velocity (RmV) curves from time-lapsed in vivo mouse caudal vertebrae data under static and cyclic mechanical loading. These curves can be fitted with piecewise linear functions as proposed in the mechanostat theory. Accordingly, new remodeling parameters can be derived from such data, including formation saturation levels (FSL), resorption velocity modulus (RVM), and remodeling thresholds (RmT). Our results revealed that the norm of the gradient of strain energy density ({nabla}SED) yielded the highest accuracy to quantify mechanoregulation data using micro-FE analysis with homogeneous material properties, while effective strain was the best predictor for micro-FE analysis with heterogeneous material properties. Furthermore, RmV curves could be accurately described with piecewise linear and hyperbola functions (root mean square error below 0.2 m/day for weekly analysis) and several remodeling parameters determined from these curves followed a logarithmic relationship with loading frequency, especially FSL and RmT values for both weekly and four-weekly analysis. Crucially, RmV curves and derived parameters could detect differences in mechanically driven bone adaptation, which complemented previous results showing a logarithmic relationship between loading frequency and net change in bone volume fraction over four weeks. Together, we expect this data to support the calibration of in silico models of bone adaptation and the characterization of the effects of mechanical loading and pharmaceutical treatment interventions in vivo.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.07.523082", "predicted_relevance": 2.13}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523134", "title": "ColMA/PEGDA Bioink for Digital Light Processing 3D Printing in Biomedical Engineering", "authors": "Chen, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jishizhan Chen", "author_corresponding_institution": "University College London", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "IntroductionDigital light processing (DLP) represents a rapid approach to constructing 3D structures with superior resolution. However, it imposes demanding requirements on the properties of bioink. Gelatine methacryloyl has long been the major option but results in limited mechanical properties. The development of collagen-based bioink provides a wider stiffness adjustment range, native bioactivities, and versatility in biomedical engineering applications.\n\nMethodCollagen solution was obtained via enzymolysis and ultrafiltration and then subjected to methacrylation. The photocrosslinkable bioink comprises collagen methacryloyl (ColMA), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), acetic acid, yellow food dye, and photoinitiator LAP. The 3D structures were fabricated utilising a commercial DLP printer with 405 nm visible light.\n\nResultsPurified type I collagen can be rapidly obtained via the developed process, and methacrylation is optimised for collagen with much less addition of methacrylic anhydride (MAA) and a high degree of substitution. The ColMA/PEGDA bioink is translucent and low viscosity and is suitable for DLP 3D printing. The printed scaffolds reached a compressive modulus over 100 kPa with 0.6 wt% collagen. Sharp-edged and fine structures ([~]500 m) were obtained by printing. The hydrogels show tunable mechanical properties by adjusting the concentration of the ColMA component. A series of models were fabricated to test the printability, including ear, cube with channels, and scaffolds, which display porous structures with pore sizes of 50 - 150 m.\n\nConclusionsAn optimised collagen-based bioink fabrication protocol was proposed for the DLP technique, covering steps from collagen extraction to ColMA/PEGDA bioink formulation and printing.

Here we leverage the developmental landscape to enable model selection on such ensembles using the relative stability of the attractors. First we show that 5 previously proposed measures of relative stability are strongly correlated and we stress the usefulness of the one that captures best the cell state transitions via the mean first passage time (MFPT) as it also allows the construction of a cellular lineage tree. A property of great computational convenience is the relative insensitivity of the different measures to changes in noise intensities. That allows us to use stochastic approaches to estimate the MFPT and thus to scale up the computations to large networks. Given this methodology, we study the landscape of 3 Boolean models of Arabidopsis thaliana root development and find that the latest one (a 2020 model) does not respect the biologically expected hierarchy of cell states based on their relative stabilities. Therefore we developed an iterative greedy algorithm that searches for models which satisfy the expected hierarchy of cell states. By applying our algorithm to the 2020 model, we find many Boolean models that do satisfy the expected hierarchy.

In this study, we provide substantial evidence that DiPRO1 plays a role in human myoblast differentiation. It acts on regulatory binding regions of SIX1, which is a master regulator of myogenesis. We further describe the relevance of DiPRO1 in mesenchymal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing sarcoma. DiPRO1 plays a repressor role in these tumors via the epigenetic regulators TIF1B and UHRF1 in order to maintain methylation of regulatory cis-elements and promoters. Loss of DiPRO1 eradicates cancer cells, by switching on a distinct transcriptional and epigenetic program. It consists of mimicking the host defense against the virus response by awakening the retrotransposable repeats (RE) and the ZNP/KZFP gene family. DiPRO1 also contributes to the balance of cellular decisions toward inflammation and/or apoptosis by controlling TNF- via NF-kappaB signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that mesenchymal cancer tumors are vulnerable in response to si/shDiPRO1-based nanomedicines, positioning DiPRO1 as a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSummary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523169v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146f1e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3265borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b52fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@654f6d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523169", "predicted_relevance": 2.08}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523174", "title": "An oviduct glycan increases sperm lifespan by diminishing ubiquinone and production of reactive oxygen species", "authors": "Hughes, J.; McMorrow, K.; Bovin, N.; Miller, D.", "author_corresponding": "David Miller", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Sperm storage by females after mating for species-dependent periods is used widely among animals with internal fertilization to allow asynchrony between mating and ovulation.

Fibrosis is associated with the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which transdifferentiate into a myofibroblast like phenotype that is contractile, proliferative and profibrogenic. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, is elevated during HSC activation and promotes the expression of profibrotic mediator HIF target genes. HIF activation during HSC activation can by either due to localised decreases in oxygen levels, or through oxygen-independent mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here we describe a role for the deubiquitinase UCHL1 in regulating HIF levels and activity during HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Increased HIF1 expression correlated with induction of UCHL1 mRNA and protein with HSC activation. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of UCHL1 impaired HIF activity through reduction of HIF1 levels. UCHL1 specifically cleaves the degradative ubiquitin chains from HIF1 leading to increased HIF1 levels, even in sufficiently oxygenated cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies have shown that UCHL1 elevates HIF activity through specific cleavage of degradative ubiquitin chains, elevates levels of pro-fibrotic gene expression and increases proliferation rates. These results demonstrate how small molecule inhibitors of DUBs can modulate the activity of HIF transcription factors in liver disease. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF activity via modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway may represent a therapeutic opportunity with other HIF-related pathologies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523142v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d82ee9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eff21aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ffb0eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b93dc9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523142", "predicted_relevance": 1.8}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523144", "title": "Allele mining of eukaryotic translation initiation factor genes in Prunus species for the identification of new sources of resistance to sharka", "authors": "Tricon, D.; Faivre-DARCIER, J.; Eyquard, J.-P.; Liu, S.; Decroocq, S.; Chague, A.; Liu, W.; Balakishiyeva, G.; Mamadov, A.; Turdiev, T.; Kostritsyna, T.; Asma, B.; Akparov, Z.; DECROOCQ, V.", "author_corresponding": "Veronique DECROOCQ", "author_corresponding_institution": "INRAE UMR 1332 BFP Virologie", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "BackgroundMembers of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex are co-opted in viral infection, leading to susceptibility in many crop species, including stone fruit trees (Prunus spp).

Integrating SRT data across multiple slices can help recover this information and improve downstream expression analyses, but multi-slice alignment and integration remains a challenging task. Existing methods for integrating SRT data either do not use spatial information or assume that the morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an assumption that is often violated due to biological or technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a method for partial alignment and 3D reconstruction of multi-slice SRT datasets, allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or slice-specific cell types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq dataset.

Current development on this field has focused on obtaining computational models to better understand its triggering mechanisms, attain realistic descriptions and study seizure suppression. Controllers have been successfully applied to mitigate epileptiform activity in dynamic models written in state-space notation, whose applicability is, however, restricted to signatures that are accurately described by them. Alternatively, autoregressive modeling (AR), a typical data-driven tool related to system identification (SI), can be directly applied to signals to generate more realistic models, and since it is inherently convertible into state-space, it can thus be used for the artificial reconstruction and attenuation of seizures as well. Considering this, the first objective of this work is to propose an SI approach using AR models to describe real epileptiform activity. The second objective is to provide a strategy for reconstructing and mitigating such activity artificially, considering non-hybrid and hybrid controllers - designed from ictal and interictal events, respectively. The results show that AR models of relatively low order represent epileptiform activities fairly well and both controllers are effective in attenuating the undesired activity while simultaneously driving the signal to an interictal stage. These findings may lead to customized models based on each signal, brain region or patient, from which it is possible to better define shape, frequency and duration of external stimuli that are necessary to attenuate seizures.\n\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is perhaps one of the most studied brain disorders and it is still not sufficiently well understood. The use of computational models is useful in this case since several simulations can be run using them, such that experience and insight about seizures can be gained without necessarily carrying out experiments. These models are usually designed with or without some knowledge about the brain region or phenomenon. Seizure attenuation approaches have been proposed for the first case, but they are limited to the type of seizure correctly described by the model. The present work proposes a similar procedure for the second one (where only the data are available and nothing else is assumed), which is regarded as more realistic due to its direct application on the signals and can lead to customized models for each activity, brain region or patient, defining important information such as the shape, frequency and duration of the external stimuli that must be applied to mitigate a seizure.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.522971", "predicted_relevance": 2.62}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523183", "title": "Engineering Escherichia coli to produce aromatic chemicals from ethylene glycol", "authors": "Panda, S.; Zhou, J.

So far, most studies have used sugars (mostly glucose) or glycerol as the primary carbon source. In this study, we used ethylene glycol (EG) as the main carbon substrate. EG could be obtained from the degradation of plastic and cellulosic wastes. As a proof of concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to transform EG into L-tyrosine, a valuable aromatic amino acid. Under the best fermentation condition, the strain produced 2 g/L L-tyrosine from 10 g/L EG at approximately 50% of the theoretical yield, outperforming glucose (the most common sugar feedstock) in the same experimental conditions. To prove the concept that EG can be converted into different aromatic chemicals, E. coli was further engineered with a similar approach to synthesize other valuable aromatic chemicals, L-phenylalanine and p-coumaric acid. Finally, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were degraded using acid hydrolysis and the resulting monomer EG was transformed into L-tyrosine using the engineered E. coli, yielding a comparable titer to that obtained using commercial EG. The strains developed in this study should be valuable to the community for producing valuable aromatics from EG.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523183", "predicted_relevance": 2.13}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523176", "title": "Dynamical information enables inference of gene regulation at single-cell scale", "authors": "Zhang, S.

Inferring these interactions from data is a notoriously difficult inverse problem that is central to systems biology. The majority of existing network inference methods work at the population level and construct a static representations of gene regulatory networks; they do not naturally allow for inference of differential regulation across a heterogeneous cell population. Building upon recent dynamical inference methods that model single cell dynamics using Markov processes, we propose locaTE, an information-theoretic approach which employs a localised transfer entropy to infer cell-specific, causal gene regulatory networks. LocaTE uses high-resolution estimates of dynamics and geometry of the cellular gene expression manifold to inform inference of regulatory interactions. We find that this approach is generally superior to using static inference methods, often by a significant margin. We demonstrate that factor analysis can give detailed insights into the inferred cell-specific GRNs. In application to two experimental datasets, we recover key transcription factors and regulatory interactions that drive mouse primitive endoderm formation and pancreatic development. For both simulated and experimental data, locaTE provides a powerful, efficient and scalable network inference method that allows us to distil cell-specific networks from single cell data.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523176", "predicted_relevance": 2.24}]
