The most studied are 24-h (circadian) and shorter (ultradian) oscillations from them. A cosinor analysis often evaluates the presence and significance of circadian and ultradian rhythms. Skilled researchers can use MATLAB, R, Python, or other programming languages, while those less experienced often use outdated applications that require a specific operating system version or outdated add-ons. Therefore, we developed CosinorOnline, a simple web-based application coded in PHP and JavaScript to evaluate the presence and significance of different oscillations. Users can set the period length on the applications page and insert their data. The results consist of a numerical evaluation and an adjustable plot. There is also a unique identifier to reload or immediately delete data analysis within one month. After this period, all data are automatically deleted from the app. We compared the functionality of CosinorOnline with Cosinor2 (R package) and Chronos-Fit (Windows app). The 24-h variability analysis was identical for all three applications. The evaluation of ultradian variability was the same for CosinorOnline and Cosinor2 and slightly different for Chronos-Fit. CosinorOnline and Chronos-Fit result in acrophase in units of time (decimal form), while Cosinor2 is in radians. In conclusion, CosinorOnline is a simple, easy-to-use web application to inspect time data that provides reliable results without additional installation and runs in modern web browsers. The application does not track users and aims to help users quickly decide whether their data is suitable for more profound analysis using cosinor analysis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/805960"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.01.29.926022", "title": "CopyMix: Mixture Model Based Single-Cell Clustering and Copy Number Profiling using Variational Inference", "authors": "Safinianaini, N.; P.

Accordingly, computational methods have emerged for single-cell copy number profiling and clustering; however, these two tasks have, up to now, been handled sequentially and included various ad-hoc preprocessing steps; hence, a procedure vulnerable to introducing clustering artifacts. We propose CopyMix, a mixture-model-based method using Variational Inference, to simultaneously cluster cells and infer a single copy number profile for each cluster, revealing the underlying copy number variation pattern for each cluster. In addition, an extension of CopyMix, SNV-CopyMix, allows the incorporation of single-nucleotide variation (SNV) data into the proposed model to further inform cluster inference. We evaluate CopyMix using simulated data and published biological data from ovarian cancer. The results reveal high clustering performance and low errors in copy number profiling.

So far, a number of deconvolution methods have emerged for estimating cell composition using reference signatures, either based on gene expression or on DNA methylation from purified cells. These two deconvolution approaches could be complementary to each other, leading to even more performant signatures, in cases where both data types are available. However, the potential relationship between signatures based on gene expression and those based on DNA methylation remains underexplored.\n\nHere we present five new deconvolution signature matrices, based RNAseq data or on DNA methylation, which can estimate the proportion of immune cells and cancer cells in a tumour sample. We test these signature matrices on available datasets for in-silico and in-vitro mixtures, peripheral blood, cancer samples from TCGA, and a single-cell melanoma dataset.

The error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway depends on specialized DNA polymerases that incorporate nucleotides in front of base lesions, potentially inducing mutagenesis. Two error-free pathways can bypass the lesions: the template switching pathway, which uses the sister chromatid as a template, and the homologous recombination pathway (HR), which also can use the homologous chromosome as template. The balance between error-prone and error-free pathways controls the mutagenesis level. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely characterize factors that influence the pathway choice to better understand genetic stability at replication forks. In yeast, the complex formed by the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 promotes HR and template-switching at stalled replication forks. At DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), this complex promotes Rad51 filament formation and stability, notably by counteracting the Srs2 anti-recombinase. To explore the role of the Rad55-Rad57 complex in error-free pathways, we monitored the genetic interactions between Rad55-Rad57, the translesion polymerases Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta}, and Srs2 following UV radiation that induces mostly single-strand DNA gaps. We found that the Rad55-Rad57 complex was involved in three ways. First, it protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2, as it does at DSBs. Second, it promotes Rad51 filament stability independently of Srs2. Finally, we observed that UV-induced HR is almost abolished in Rad55-Rad57 deficient cells, and is partially restored upon Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta} depletion. Hence, we propose that the Rad55-Rad57 complex is essential to promote Rad51 filament stability on single-strand DNA gaps, notably to counteract the error-prone TLS polymerases and mutagenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryProcessive and accurate DNA polymerases replicate genomic DNA during the S phase of each cell cycle. DNA base lesions on template DNA block these polymerases and result in an accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps behind moving replication forks. These gaps are filled-in by error-prone and error-free pathways. In this work, we show that the complex made by the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 is essential for the error-free homologous recombination gap-filling pathway when DNA replication is stalled by UV-induced DNA lesions, but not for DNA double strand break repair. Interestingly, we found that homologous recombination is efficiently outcompeted by error-prone translesion DNA polymerases in Rad55-Rad57-deficient cells. We propose that the Rad55-Rad57 complex is essential for Rad51 filament stability at UV-induced DNA gaps to promote efficient error-free homologous recombination. Furthermore, our study in yeast predicts that inhibitors of error-prone DNA polymerases might selectively target cancer cells in which RAD51 paralogs are mutated.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2021.05.27.446004"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.06.16.448102", "title": "Defining protein variant functions using high-complexity mutagenesis libraries and enhanced mutant detection software ASMv1.0", "authors": "Yang, X.; Hong, A.

Here we show that BAZ2A represses genes implicated in PCa through its RNA-binding TAM domain using mechanisms differing from rRNA gene silencing. While TAM domain mediates BAZ2A recruitment to rRNA genes, in PCa cells this is not required for BAZ2A association with target genes. Instead, BAZ2A-TAM domain in association with RNA mediates the interaction with topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and histone demethylase KDM1A, whose expression positively correlates with BAZ2A levels in both localized and aggressive PCa. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP2A and KDM1A activities upregulates the expression of BAZ2A-repressed genes that are regulated by a class of inactive enhancers bound by BAZ2A whereas rRNA genes are not affected.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is becoming an increasingly important tool for genetic diagnosis of diseases including idiopathic infertility, however, most rare or minor alleles revealed by HTS are variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Interpreting the functional impacts of VUS is challenging but profoundly important for clinical management and genetic counseling. To determine the consequences of population polymorphisms in key fertility genes, we functionally evaluated 11 missense variants in the genes ANKRD31, BRDT, DMC1, EXOI, FKBP6, MCM9, M1AP, MEI1, MSH4 and SEPT12 by generating genome-edited mouse models. Nine variants were classified as deleterious by most functional prediction algorithms, and two disrupted a protein-protein interaction in the yeast 2 hybrid assay. Even though these genes are known to be essential for normal meiosis or spermiogenesis in mice, only one of the tested human variants (rs1460351219, encoding p.R581H in MCM9), which was observed in a male infertility patient, compromised fertility or gametogenesis in the mouse models. To explore the disconnect between predictions and outcomes, we compared pathogenicity calls of missense variants made by ten widely-used algorithms to: 1) those present in ClinVar, and 2) those which have been evaluated in mice. We found that all the algorithms performed poorly in terms of predicting the effects of human missense variants that have been modeled in mice. These studies emphasize caution in the genetic diagnoses of infertile patients based primarily on pathogenicity prediction algorithms, and emphasize the need for alternative and efficient in vitro or vivo functional validation models for more effective and accurate VUS delineation to either pathogenic or benign categories.\n\nSignificanceAlthough infertility is a substantial medical problem that affects up to 15% of couples, the potential genetic causes of idiopathic infertility have been difficult to decipher. This problem is complicated by the large number of genes that can cause infertility when perturbed, coupled with the large number of VUS that are present in the genomes of affected patients. Here, we present and analyze mouse modeling data of missense variants that are classified as deleterious by commonly-used pathogenicity prediction algorithms but which caused no detectible phenotype when introduced into mice by genome editing. We find that augmenting pathogenicity predictions with preliminary screens for biochemical defects substantially enhanced the proportion of prioritized variants that caused phenotypes in mice. The results emphasize that, in the absence of substantial improvements of in silico prediction tools or other compelling pre-existing evidence, in vivo analysis is crucial for confident attribution of infertility alleles.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2021.10.12.464112"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.11.02.466997", "title": "Novel insights into the cold resistance of Hevea brasiliensis through coexpression networks", "authors": "Silva, C.

Together with traditional differential expression approaches, a RNA-seq gene co-expression network (GCN) was established with 27,220 genes that were grouped into 205 gene clusters.

The hub genes of the cold-responsive modules were identified and analyzed as well. Considering the three modules and hub genes identified, the general Hevea response to short term cold exposure involves a complex regulation of Jasmonic Acid (JA) stress response and programmed cell death (PCD), up-regulation of Ethylene responsive genes and relaxation on the inhibition of florigen genes.

The model is parameterized to reproduce the experimental Hi-C map of the wild type (WT) nuclei; it describes time evolution of the chromatin over the G1 phase of the interphase. Best agreement with the experiment is achieved when the simulations include an ensemble of nuclei, corresponding to the experimentally observed set of several possible mutual arrangements of chromosomal arms. The model is validated against multiple structural features of chromatin from several different experiments not used in model development, including those that describe changes in chromatin induced by lamin depletion. Predicted positioning of all LADs at the NE is highly dynamic - the same LAD can attach, detach and move far away from the NE multiple times during interphase. The probabilities of LADs to be in contact with the NE vary by an order of magnitude, despite all having the same affinity to the NE in the model. These probabilities are mostly determined by a highly variable local linear density of LADs along the genome which also has a strong effect on the predicted radial positioning of individual TADs. Higher probability of a TAD to be near NE is largely determined by a higher linear density of LADs surrounding this TAD. The distribution of LADs along the chromosome chains plays a notable role in maintaining a non-random average global structure of chromatin. Relatively high affinity of LADs to the NE in the WT nuclei substantially reduces sensitivity of the global radial chromatin distribution to variations in the strength of TAD-TAD interactions compared to the lamin depleted nuclei, where a 0.5 kT increase of cross-type TAD-TAD interactions doubles the chromatin density in the central nucleus region.\n\nConclusionsA dynamical model of the entire fruit fly genome makes multiple genome-wide predictions of biological interest. The distribution of LADs along the chromatin chains affects their probabilities to be in contact with the NE and radial positioning of highly mobile TADs, playing a notable role in creating a non-random average global structure of the chromatin. We conjecture that an important role of attractive LAD-NE interactions is to stabilize global chromatin structure against inevitable cell-to-cell variations in TAD-TAD interactions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2022.01.28.478236"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.02.09.479725", "title": "The LINC complex inhibits excessive chromatin repression", "authors": "Amiad Pavlov, D.; Unnikannan, C.; Lorber, D.; Bajpai, G.; Olender, T.; Stoops, E.; Reuveny, A.; Safran, S.; Volk, T.", "author_corresponding": "Talila  Volk", "author_corresponding_institution": "Weizmann Institute of Science", "date": "2023-01-04", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "We show here that the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex is needed to minimize chromatin repression.

Whereas crystallographic and computational studies have linked inactivation to a  collapsed selectivity filter conformation in the KcsA channel, the structural basis for selectivity filter gating in other K+ channels has been less clear. Here, we combined electrophysiological recordings with molecular dynamics based, in silico electrophysiology simulations, to study selectivity filter gating in the model potassium channel MthK and its V55E mutant (analogous to KcsA E71) in the pore-helix. Experimentally, we find that MthK V55E has a lower open probability than the WT channel, due to decreased stability of the open state, as well as a lower unitary conductance. Simulations account for both aspects of these observations on the atomistic scale, showing that ion permeation in V55E is altered by two distinct orientations of the E55 side chain. In the  vertical orientation of E55, in which E55 forms a hydrogen bond with D64 (as observed with KcsA WT channels), the filter displays reduced conductance compared to MthK WT. In contrast, with  horizontal orientation, K+ conductance is closer to MthK WT; however the selectivity filter stability in the conducting conformation is lowered, and the filter more readily transitions to the inactivated conformation.

Plant breeders evaluate new soybean genotypes using multi-environment trials (MET). The application of MET assumes that trial locations provide representative environmental conditions that cultivars are likely to encounter when grown by farmers. In addition, MET are important to depict the patterns of genotype by environment interactions (GEI). To evaluate GEI for soybean seed yield and identify mega-environments (ME), a retrospective analysis of 39,006 data points from experimental soybean genotypes evaluated in preliminary and uniform field trials conducted by public plant breeders from 1989-2019 was considered. ME were identified from phenotypic information from the annual trials, geographic, soil, and meteorological records at the trial locations. Results indicate that yield variation was mostly explained by location and location by year interactions. The static portion of the GEI represented 26.30% of the total yield variance. Estimates of variance components derived from linear mixed models demonstrated that the phenotypic variation due to genotype by location interaction effects was greater than genotype by year interaction effects. A trend analysis indicated a two-fold increase in the genotypic variance between 1989-1995 and 1996-2019. Furthermore, the heterogeneous estimates of genotypic, genotype by location, genotype by year, and genotype by location by year variances, were encapsulated by distinct probability distributions. The observed target population of environments can be divided into at least two and at most three ME, thereby suggesting improvements in the response to selection can be achieved when selecting directly for clustered (i.e., regions, ME) versus selecting across regions.

We conducted an unbiased phosphoproteomics analysis in order to determine the role of altered protein phosphorylation in the chronic adaptive heart performance and protection profile of adult TGAC8 LV at 3-4 months of age. We identified 12,963 phospho-peptides and 3646 phosphoproteins, including 4990 upregulated phosphopeptides and 781 differentially regulated (741 Up and 40 Down) phosphoproteins in TGAC8 vs. WT. Based on differentially regulated phosphoproteins by genotype, numerous stress response canonical pathways within reprogrammed TGAC8 LV, including protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, PI3K signaling, and AMPK signaling, predicted upstream regulators, e.g., PDPK1, PAK1 and PTK2B, and downstream functions, e.g., cell viability, protein quality control, and metabolism were enriched. In addition to PKA, numerous kinases (83) and phosphatases (30) were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs. WT. Hyper-phosphorylated transcriptional factors in TGAC8 were associated with increased mRNA transcription, and immune responses and metabolism pathways. Combining the phosphoproteome with its proteome and with the previously published TGAC8 transcriptome enabled the elucidation of which cardiac performance and adaptive protection profiles were coordinately regulated at post-translational modification (PTM) (phosphorylation), translational and transcriptional levels. Many stress response signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK and ubiquitin labeling, were consistently enriched at transcriptional, translational and PTM levels, and that PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways were also activated in the TGAC8 LV. We verified some results via western blot and protein synthesis and degradation detection experiments.

Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40-nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelganger Simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak non-ergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, cytoskeletal effects, cell cycle stage and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not \"well-mixed\" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40-nm sizescale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population. These findings carry significant implications for the origins and regulation of biological noise at cellular and subcellular levels.\n\nSignificanceBiophysical properties of the cytoplasm influence many cellular processes, from differentiation to cytoskeletal dynamics, yet little is known about how tightly cells control these properties. We developed a combined experimental and computational approach to analyze cytoplasmic heterogeneity through the lens of diffusion. We find that the apparent cytoplasmic viscosity varies tremendously - over 100-fold within any individual cell, and over 10-fold among individual cells when comparing averages of all particles measured for each cell. The variance was largely independent of temperature, the cytoskeleton, cell cycle stage, and localization, but was magnified under hyperosmotic shock. This suggests that cytoplasmic heterogeneity contributes substantially to biological variability within and between cells, and has significant implications for any cellular process that depends on diffusion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/491518v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6faeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a49dc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171d62borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3c7bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2022.05.11.491518"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.05.25.493416", "title": "ADOPT: intrinsic protein disorder prediction through deep bidirectional transformers", "authors": "Tamiola, K.; Fisicaro, C.; Dutton, O.; Hoffmann, F.; Henderson, L.; Owens, B.

AGs are lysosome-related organelles (LROs) and store the hemostatic protein Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the transmembrane protein P-selectin. Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are LROs of endothelial cells and also store VWF and P-selectin. In megakaryocytes, NBEAL2 links P-selectin on AGs to the SNARE protein SEC22B on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby preventing premature release of cargo from AG precursors. In endothelial cells, SEC22B drives VWF trafficking from ER to Golgi and promotes the formation of elongated WPBs, but it is unclear if this requires NBEAL2.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate a potential role for NBEAL2 in WPB biogenesis and VWF secretion using NBEAL2 deficient endothelial cells.\n\nMethodsInteraction of SEC22B with NBEAL2 in endothelial cells was investigated by interactomic mass spectrometry and pull down analysis. Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs) were isolated from healthy controls and 3 unrelated GPS patients with mutations in NBEAL2.\n\nResultsWe show that SEC22B binds to NBEAL2 in ECs. GPS patient-derived ECFCs are deficient of NBEAL2, but reveal normal formation and maturation of WPBs and normal WPB cargo recruitment.

Commonly, during CM the individuals of the group avoid collisions. These CM and collision avoidance (CA) behaviors are based on input from the environment such as smell, air pressure, and vision, all of which are processed by the individual and defined action. In this work, a novel vision-based CM with CA model (i.e., VCMCA) that is simulating the collective evolution learning process is proposed. In this setting, a learning agent obtains a visual signal about its environment, and throughout trial-and-error over multiple attempts, the individual learns to perform a local CM with CA which emerges into a global CM with CA dynamics. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in the case of locusts swarms, showing the evolution of these behaviors in a swarm from the learning process of the individual in the swarm. Thus, this work proposes a biologically-inspired learning process to obtain multi-agent multi-objective dynamics.\n\nAuthor summaryMulti-agent multi-objective tasks are common in nature with examples as collective movement in birds and economic management in humans. These problems are famous for being convoluted to efficiently solve. Nonetheless, nature has been successfully solving it for millennials using an evolution strategy. A prominent example is a task of flocking performed by multiple species, which involves both collective motion and collision avoidance. In our work, we simulate agents that are able to learn behaviors on the individual level, that in turn translate into the desired group (multi-agent) behavior. Using nature-inspired genetical algorithms and reinforcement-learning methods, the agents are successfully implementing a collective behavior similar to the one encountered in nature.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2022.06.09.495429"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.06.12.495855", "title": "Hotspot of de novo telomere addition stabilizes linear amplicons in yeast grown in sulfate-limiting conditions", "authors": "Hoerr, R.

A broad form of genetic variation is the amplification or deletion of DNA ([&ge;]50 bp) referred to as copy number variation. In humans, copy number variation may be inconsequential, contribute to minor phenotypic differences, or cause conditions such as birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancers. To identify mechanisms that drive copy number variation, we monitored the experimental evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations grown under sulfate-limiting conditions. Cells with increased copy number of the gene SUL1, which encodes a primary sulfate transporter, exhibit a fitness advantage. Previously, we reported interstitial inverted triplications of SUL1 as the dominant rearrangement in a haploid population. Here, in a diploid population, we find instead that small linear fragments containing SUL1 form and are sustained over several generations. Many of the linear fragments are stabilized by de novo telomere addition within a telomere-like sequence near SUL1 (within the SNF5 gene). Using an assay that monitors telomerase action following an induced chromosome break, we show that this region acts as a hotspot of de novo telomere addition and that required sequences map to a region of <250 base pairs. Consistent with previous work showing that association of the telomere-binding protein Cdc13 with internal sequences stimulates telomerase recruitment, mutation of a four-nucleotide motif predicted to associate with Cdc13 abolishes de novo telomere addition. Our study suggests that internal telomere-like sequences that stimulate de novo telomere addition can contribute to adaptation by promoting genomic plasticity.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/16/2022.06.12.495855"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.06.20.496912", "title": "High-throughput phenotyping of infection by diverse microsporidia species reveals a wild C. elegans strain with opposing resistance and susceptibility traits", "authors": "Mok, C.; Xiao, M.

The programs were used to compare the structures of two sets of  Never Born proteins that had been expressed - Group 1, which had been shown experimentally to possess substantial secondary structure, and Group 3, which had been shown to be intrinsically disordered. Overall, the models generated were scored as being of low quality but revealed some general principles. Specifically, all four members of Group 1 were predicted to be compact by all three algorithms. The members of Group 3 were predicted to be very extended, as would be expected for intrinsically disordered proteins. The three programs were then used to predict the structures of three orphan proteins whose crystal structures had been solved, two of which display novel folds. Finally, they were used to predict the structures of seven orphan proteins with well-identified biological functions, whose 3D structures are not known. Two proteins, which were predicted to be disordered based on their sequences, are predicted by all three structure algorithms to be extended structures. The other five were predicted to be compact structures with two exceptions in the case of AlphaFold2. All three prediction algorithms make remarkably similar and high-quality predictions for one large protein, HCO_11565, from a nematode. It is conjectured that this is due to many homologs in the taxonomically restricted family of which it is a member and to the fact that the Dali server revealed several non-related proteins with similar folds.

Compared to shared SAVs, archaic-specific SAVs occur in sites under weaker selection and are more common in genes with tissue-specific expression. Further underscoring the importance of negative selection on SAVs, Neanderthal lineages with low effective population sizes are enriched for SAVs compared to Denisovan and shared SAVs.

We propose a new framework to get the best of both worlds by integrating together information across hundreds of MDD-relevant phenotypes. First, we use phenotype imputation to increase sample size for the deepest available MDD phenotype, which dramatically improves GWAS power (increases #loci ~10 fold) and PRS accuracy (increases R2 ~2 fold). Further, we show the genetic architecture of the imputed phenotype remains specific to MDD using genetic correlation, PRS prediction in external clinical cohorts, and a novel PRS-based pleiotropy metric. We also develop a complementary approach to improve specificity of GWAS on shallow MDD phenotypes by adjusting for phenome-wide PCs. Finally, we study phenotype integration at the level of GWAS summary statistics, which can increase GWAS and PRS power but introduces non-MDD-specific signals.

The white-tailed deer is currently expanding, while caribou are in the midst of a significant decline. Mountain goats remain stable, having suffered a large historical bottleneck. We assessed genome-wide signatures of inbreeding using the inbreeding coefficient F and %ROH (FROH) and identified evolutionarily constrained regions with GERP. Mutational load was estimated by identifying mutations in highly constrained elements (CEs) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) mutations. Our results show that F and FROH are higher in mountain goats than in caribou and white-tailed deer. Given the extended bottleneck and low Ne of the mountain goat, this supports the idea that the genome-wide effects of demographic change take time to accrue. Similarly, we found that mountain goats possess more highly constrained CEs and the lowest dN/dS values, both of which are indicative of greater purifying selection; this is also reflected by fewer mutations in CEs and deleterious mutations identified by SIFT. In contrast, white-tailed deer presented the highest mutational load with both metrics, in addition to dN/dS, while caribou were intermediate. Our results demonstrate that extended bottlenecks may lead to reduced diversity and increased FROH in ungulates, but not necessarily the accumulation of deleterious alleles, likely due to the purging of deleterious alleles in small populations.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2022.08.16.503900"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.08.17.503867", "title": "promor: a comprehensive R package for label-free proteomics data analysis and predictive modeling", "authors": "Ranathunge, C.; Patel, S.

In particular, we need efficient yet cost-effective ways to measure CpG methylation states over large and complete regions of the genome. Here, we develop TEEM-Seq (target-enriched enzymatic methyl sequencing), a method that combines enzymatic methyl sequencing with a custom-designed hybridization capture bait set that can be scaled to reactions including large numbers of samples in any species for which a reference genome is available. Using DNA from a passerine bird, the superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), we show that TEEM-Seq is able to quantify DNA methylation states similarly well to the more traditional approaches of whole-genome and reduced-representation sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrate its reliability and repeatability, as duplicate libraries from the same samples were highly correlated. Importantly, the downstream bioinformatic analysis for TEEM-Seq is the same as for any sequence-based approach to studying DNA methylation, making it simple to incorporate into a variety of workflows. We believe that TEEM-Seq could replace traditional approaches for studying DNA methylation in candidate genes and pathways, and be effectively paired with other whole-genome or reduced-representation sequencing approaches to increase project sample sizes. In addition, TEEM-Seq can be combined with mRNA sequencing to examine how DNA methylation in promoters or other regulatory regions is related to the expression of individual genes or gene networks.

However, genome-wide G4s characterized through high-throughput sequencing suggest that these structures form at a large number of regions with no such canonical G4-forming signatures. Many G4-binding proteins have been described with no evidence for any protein that binds to and stabilizes G4s. It remains unknown what fraction of G4s formed in human cells are protein-bound. The G4-chromatin immunoprecipitation (G4-ChIP) method hitherto employed to describe G4 landscapes preferentially reports G4s that get crosslinked to proteins in their proximity. Our current understanding of the G4 landscape is biased against representation of G4s which escape crosslinking as they are not stabilized by protein-binding and presumably transient. We report a protocol that captures G4s from the cells efficiently without any bias as well as eliminates the detection of G4s formed artifactually on crosslinked sheared chromatin post-fixation. We discover that G4s form sparingly at SINEs. An application of this method shows that depletion of a repeat-binding protein CGGBP1 enhances net G4 capture at CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites and regions of sharp interstrand G/C-skew transitions. Thus, we present an improved method for G4 landscape determination and by applying it we show that sequence property-specific constraints of the nuclear environment mitigate G4 formation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2022.09.03.506459"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.15.508150", "title": "Phosphorylation sites are evolutionary checkpoints against liquid-solid transition in protein condensates", "authors": "Ranganathan, S.; Dasmeh, P.; Furniss, S.; Shakhnovich, E.", "author_corresponding": "Eugene Shakhnovich", "author_corresponding_institution": "Harvard University", "date": "2023-01-13", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Assemblies of multivalent RNA-binding protein FUS can exist in the functional liquid-like state as well as less dynamic and potentially toxic amyloid- and hydrogel-like states. How could then cells form liquid-like condensates while avoiding their transformation to amyloids? Here we show how post-translational phosphorylation can provide a \"handle\" that prevents liquid-solid transition of intracellular condensates containing FUS. Using residue-specific coarse-grained simulations, for 85 different mammalian FUS sequences, we show how the number of phosphorylation sites and their spatial arrangement affect intracluster dynamics preventing conversion to amyloids. All atom simulations further confirm that phosphorylation can effectively reduce the {beta}-sheet propensity in amyloid-prone fragments of FUS. A detailed evolutionary analysis shows that mammalian FUS PLDs are enriched in amyloid-prone stretches compared to control neutrally evolved sequences suggesting that mammalian FUS proteins evolved to self-assemble. However, in stark contrast to proteins that do not phase-separate for their function, mammalian sequences have phosphosites in close proximity to these amyloid-prone regions. These results suggest that evolution uses amyloid-prone sequences in prion-like domains to enhance phase-separation of condensate proteins while enriching phosphorylation sites in close proximity to safe-guard against liquid-solid transitions.\n\nSignificance StatementIntrinsically disordered regions and prion-like domains are widely observed in proteins that get enriched in membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Mammalian Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) sequences are significantly enriched in amyloid-prone sequences suggesting that they have evolved to self-assemble. While the amyloid-prone stretches promote self-assembly of these proteins at lower threshold concentrations, these assemblies are vulnerable to aberrant liquid-solid phase transitions. Molecular simulations and bioinformatics analyses show that evolution overcomes this challenge by placing phosphosites specifically close to amyloid-prone stretches. Introduction of negatively charged residues at phosphosite locations results in fewer amyloid-prone contacts and thereby lower beta-sheet propensity. Phosphorylation can thus allow cells to utilize amyloid-prone stretches to promote biogenesis of MLOs while protecting against liquid-solid transitions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2022.09.15.508150"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.14.508015", "title": "Transcriptional patterns of sexual dimorphism and in host developmental programs in the model parasitic nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri", "authors": "Pollo, S.

While draft genome sequences are available for this worm, which allow for comparative genomic analyses between nematodes, there is a notable lack of information on its gene expression. Here, we have generated biologically replicated RNA-seq datasets from samples taken throughout the parasitic life of H. bakeri. We find extensive transcriptional sexual dimorphism throughout the fourth larval and adult stages of this parasite and identify alternative splicing, glycosylation, and ubiquitination as particularly important processes for establishing and/or maintaining sex-specific gene expression in this species. Further, we find sex-linked differences in transcription related to aging and oxidative and osmotic stress responses. Additionally, we observe a starvation-like signature among transcripts whose expression is consistently up-regulated in males, which may reflect a higher energy expenditure by male worms. We detect evidence of increased importance for anaerobic respiration among the adult worms, which coincides with the parasites migration into the physiologically hypoxic environment of the intestinal lumen. Further, we hypothesize that oxygen concentration may be an important driver of the worms encysting in the intestinal mucosa as larvae, which not only fully exposes the worms to their hosts immune system, but also shapes many of the interactions between the host and parasite. We find stage- and sex-specific variation in the expression of immunomodulatory genes and in anthelmintic targets. In addition to generating new hypotheses for follow-up experiments into the worms behaviour, physiology, and metabolism, our datasets enable future more in-depth comparisons between nematodes to better define the utility of H. bakeri as a model for parasitic nematodes in general.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasitic nematodes (roundworms) that infect humans and livestock are a major health and economic burden but are challenging to study in a laboratory environment because of their required hosts. One strategy to get around this difficulty is to first study a rodent model to guide targeted experiments in the more difficult study system. Heligmosomoides bakeri is closely related to the nematode parasites of humans and livestock and naturally parasitizes mice. We have generated information on the expression of all the genes in this worm throughout the stages of its life when it is parasitic. This information allows us to examine how different the male and female worms are at the molecular level. We also describe major developmental events that occur in the worm, which extend our understanding of the interactions between this parasite and its host. We analyse the expression of genes known to be involved in interfering with host immune responses and others known to be targeted by drugs designed to kill worms. This new information will allow for better comparisons among nematodes to assess how well this rodent model system works for studying parasitic nematodes in general.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2022.09.14.508015"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.10.05.510924", "title": "Genomic Analysis of Two Phlebotomine Sand Fly Vectors of Leishmania from the New and Old World", "authors": "McDowell, M.

More than 40 pathogenic Leishmania species are transmitted to humans by approximately 35 sand fly species in 98 countries with hundreds of millions of people at risk around the world. As no approved efficacious vaccine exists, available drugs are expensive and/or toxic, and resistance is emerging, management of sand fly populations to break transmission is currently the most effective disease control strategy. To better understand the biology of sand flies, including the mechanisms involved in their vectorial capacity, insecticide resistance, and population structures we sequenced the genomes of two of the most important sand fly species: Phlebotomus papatasi, a cutaneous leishmaniasis vector, (distributed in the Middle East and North Africa) and Lutzomyia longipalpis, a visceral leishmaniasis vector (distributed across Central and South America). We categorized and curated genes involved in processes important to their roles as disease vectors, including chemosensation, blood feeding, circadian rhythm, immunity, and detoxification, as well as mobile genetic elements. We also defined gene orthology and observed micro-synteny among the genomes. Finally, we present the genetic diversity and population structure of these species in their respective geographical areas. These genomes will be a foundation on which to base future efforts to prevent vector-borne transmission of Leishmania parasites.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe leishmaniases are a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by protist parasites from the Genus Leishmania. Different Leishmania species present a wide clinical profile, ranging from mild, often self-resolving cutaneous lesions that can lead to protective immunity, to severe metastatic mucosal disease, to visceral disease that is ultimately fatal. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bites of sand flies, and as no approved vaccine exists, available drugs are toxic and/or expensive and resistance is emerging, new dual control strategies to combat these diseases must be developed, combining interventions on human infections and integrated sand fly population management. Effective vector control requires a good understanding of the biology of sand flies. To this end, we sequenced and annotated the genomes of two sand fly species that are important leishmaniasis vectors from the Old and New Worlds. These genomes allow us to better understand, at the genetic level, processes important in the vector biology of these species, such as finding hosts, blood-feeding, immunity, and detoxification. These genomic resources highlight the driving forces of evolution of two major Leishmania vectors and provide foundations for future research on how to better prevent leishmaniasis by control of the sand fly vectors.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2022.10.05.510924"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.10.07.511322", "title": "EquiFold: Protein Structure Prediction with a Novel Coarse-Grained Structure Representation", "authors": "Lee, J.

The contribution of these three components of SAT was investigated in three different segments of the axon: the proximal portion, the central portion, and the distal portion of the axon. MAP1B protein was used as a model system to study SAT because there are published experimental data reporting MAP1B distribution along the axon length and average velocity of MAP1B transport in the axon. This allows the optimization approach to be used to find values of model kinetic constants that give the best fit with published experimental data. The effects of decreasing the value of cargo diffusivity on the diffusion-driven component of SAT and decreasing the value of dynein velocity on the retrograde motor-driven component of SAT were investigated. We found that for the case when protein diffusivity and dynein velocity are very small, it is possible to obtain an analytical solution to model equations. We found that, in this case, the protein concentration in the axon is uniform. This shows that anterograde motor-driven transport alone cannot simulate a variation of cargo concentration in the axon. Most proteins are non-uniformly distributed in axons. They may exhibit, for example, an increased concentration closer to the synapse.

Sequences strongly clustered by sampling location, suggesting a highly focal geographical distribution. Our analyses further indicated that Powassan virus lineage II emerged in the northeastern U.S. mostly following a south to north pattern, with a weighted lineage dispersal velocity of ~3 km/year. Since the emergence in the Northeast, we found an overall increase in the effective population size of Powassan virus lineage II, but with growth stagnating during recent years.

In order to enhance ML models to better predict the synthetic promoter strength, we propose EVMP(Extended Vision Mutant Priority), a universal framework which utilize mutation information more effectively. In EVMP, synthetic promoters are equivalently transformed into base promoter and corresponding k-mer mutations, which are input into BaseEncoder and VarEncoder respectively.

EVMP also provides optional data augmentation based on multiple base promoters, which further improved the model performance by 22.2% compared with non-EVMP SOTA record. In further study, extended vision is shown to be essential for EVMP. We also found that EVMP can alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon, which may contribute to its effectiveness.

Here we report the development of a novel CD46-targeted alpha therapy based on YS5. We conjugated 212Pb, an in vivo generator of alpha-emitting 212Bi and 212Po, to YS5 through the chelator TCMC to create the radioimmunoconjugate, 212Pb-TCMC-YS5. We characterized 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 in vitro and established a safe dose in vivo. We next studied therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 using three prostate cancer small animal models: a subcutaneous mCRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model (subcu-CDX), an orthotopically grafted mCRPC CDX model (ortho-CDX), and a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft model (PDX). In all three models, a single dose of 20 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 was well tolerated and caused potent and sustained inhibition of established tumors, with significant increases of survival in treated animals. A lower dose (10 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5) was also studied on the PDX model, which also showed a significant effect on tumor growth inhibition and prolongation of animal survival.

Mora is able to accurately re-assign reads by first estimating abundances through an expectation-maximization algorithm and then utilizing abundance information to re-assign query reads. The key idea behind Mora is to maximize read re-assignment qualities while simultaneously minimizing the difference from estimated abundance levels, allowing Mora to avoid over assigning reads to the same genomes. On simulated data, this allows Mora to achieve F1 scores of > 74% when assigning reads generated from three distinct E. coli strains, more than double of the F1 scores achieved by Pathoscope2, Pufferfish, Clark, and Bowtie2.

It was unclear how RanGTP and the cargo H2A-H2B can bind simultaneously to an importin, and how interactions of the three components position H2A-H2B for nucleosome assembly.

In metazoans, plants, and many filamentous fungi, facultative heterochromatin is characterized by transcriptional repression and enrichment with nucleosomes that are trimethylated at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion of kmt5, the gene encoding the sole methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 methylation, resulted in global derepression of transcription, especially in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Reversal of silencing in the absence of H4K20me3 not only affected genes but also a large number of novel, previously undetected, non-coding transcripts generated from regions of facultative heterochromatin on accessory chromosomes. Transcriptional activation in kmt5 deletion strains was accompanied by a complete loss of Ash1-mediated H3K36me3 and chromatin reorganization affecting H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 distribution in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Strains with a H4K20M mutation in the single histone H4 gene of Z. tritici recapitulated these chromatin changes, suggesting that H4K20me3 is essential for Ash1-mediated H3K36me3. The {Delta}kmt5 mutants we obtained are more sensitive to genotoxic stressors and both, {Delta}kmt5 and {Delta}ash1, showed greatly increased rates of accessory chromosome loss. Taken together, our results provide insights into a novel, and unsuspected, mechanism controlling the assembly and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin.\n\nSignificanceFacultative heterochromatin contains genes important for specific developmental or life cycle stages. Transcriptional regulation of these genes is influenced by chromatin structure. Here, we report that a little studied histone modification, trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me3), is enriched in facultative heterochromatin and important for transcriptional repression in these regions in an important agricultural pathogen. Furthermore, normal levels of H4K20me3 are essential for deposition of another repressive histone mark, Ash1-mediated H3K36me3, and affect the distribution of other marks including H3K27me3.

Our analysis uncovered H3K9-methylated heterochromatin as the major chromatin modification repressing transcription in these fungi, which lack both Polycomb silencing and cytosine methylation. Although small RNAs generated by RNAi pathways facilitate the formation of heterochromatin in many eukaryotic organisms, we show that RNAi is not required to maintain either genomic or centromeric heterochromatin in Mucor. H3K9-methylation and RNAi act independently to control centromeric regions, suggesting a functional sub-specialization. Whereas the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and heterochromatin formation are essential for cell viability, RNAi is dispensable for viability yet acts as the main epigenetic, regulatory force repressing transposition of centromeric GremLINE1 elements. Mutations inactivating canonical RNAi lead to rampant transposition and insertional inactivation of targets resulting in antimicrobial drug resistance. This fine-tuned, Rdrp2-dependent RNAi activity is critical for genome stability, restricting GremLINE1 retroelements to the centromeres where they occupy long heterochromatic islands. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi and heterochromatin formation are independent genome defense and regulatory mechanisms in the Mucorales, contributing to a paradigm shift from the co-transcriptional gene silencing observed in fission yeasts to models in which heterochromatin and RNAi operate independently in early-diverging fungi.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2022.12.01.518749"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.06.519258", "title": "Competitive, connective and allosteric Nanobodies that modulate the SOS1-RAS protein-protein interactions and tune the nucleotide exchange rate as a starting point for drug design", "authors": "Fischer, B.; Uchanski, T.; Sheryazdanova, A.; Gonzalez, S.; Volkov, A.

In this study, we evaluate the importance of coding-sequence changes to the recent evolution of a novel anthocyanin pigmentation trait in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus. The magenta-flowered Mimulus luteus var. variegatus recently gained petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation via a single-locus Mendelian difference from its sister taxon, the yellow-flowered M. l. luteus.

We overexpressed the genomically encoded protein-coding sequences of MYB5a, from both M. l. luteus and M. l. variegatus, in Nicotiana tabacum leaves, in order to test their efficacy as anthocyanin-pigment activators. Quantitative image analysis of transfected tobacco leaves revealed robust anthocyanin production driven by both types of transgenes, compared to a negative control, and overall functional equivalency between the luteus and variegatus alleles. This finding supports the hypothesis that petal pigment was not gained by protein-coding changes in M. l. variegatus, but instead via non-coding cis-regulatory evolution.

However, how this Ca2+ flux into the lumen of the TGN is achieved remains elusive, as the cytosol has a very low steady-state Ca2+ concentration. The TGN forms membrane contact sites (MCS) with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), whereby the close apposition of the two organelles allows the protein-mediated exchange of molecular species such as lipids.

In this study, we explored the possibility of using deep learning to differentiate HSCs and MPPs based on their light microscopy (DIC) images. After extensive training and validation with large image data sets, we successfully develop a three-class classifier (we named it the LSM model) that reliably differentiate long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and MPPs. Importantly, we demonstrated that our LSM model achieved its differentiating capability by learning the intrinsic morphological features from cell images. Furthermore, we showed that the performance of our LSM model was not affected by how these cells were identified and isolated, i.e., sorted by surface markers or intracellular GFP markers. Prospective identification of HSCs and MPPs in Evi1GFP transgenic mice by LSM model suggested that the cells with the highest GFP expression were LT-HSCs, and this prediction was substantiated later by a long-term competitive reconstitution assay. Moreover, based on DIC image data sets, we also successfully built another two-class classifier that can effectively distinguish aged HSCs from young HSCs, which both express the same surface markers but are functionally different. This finding is of particular interest since it may provide a novel quick and efficient approach, obviating the need for a time-consuming transplantation experiment, to evaluate the functional states of HSCs.

During spindle checkpoint activation, checkpoint proteins bind the unattached kinetochore and send a diffusible signal to inhibit the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Previous work has shown that mitotic cells with depolymerized microtubules can escape prolonged spindle checkpoint activation in a process called mitotic slippage. During slippage, spindle checkpoint proteins bind unattached kinetochores, but the cells cannot maintain the checkpoint arrest. We asked if meiotic cells had as robust of a spindle checkpoint response as mitotic cells and whether they also undergo slippage after prolonged spindle checkpoint activity. We performed a direct comparison between mitotic and meiotic budding yeast cells that signal the spindle checkpoint due to a lack of either kinetochore-microtubule attachments or due to a loss of tension-bearing attachments. We find that the spindle checkpoint is not as robust in meiosis I or meiosis II compared to mitosis, overcoming a checkpoint arrest approximately 150 minutes earlier in meiosis. In addition, cells in meiosis I escape spindle checkpoint signaling using two mechanisms, silencing the checkpoint at the kinetochore and through slippage. We propose that meiotic cells undertake developmentally-regulated mechanisms to prevent persistent spindle checkpoint activity to ensure the production of gametes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMitosis and meiosis are the two major types of cell divisions. Mitosis gives rise to genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis is a reductional division that gives rise to gametes. Cell cycle checkpoints are highly regulated surveillance mechanisms that prevent cell cycle progression when circumstances are unfavorable. The spindle checkpoint promotes faithful chromosome segregation to safeguard against aneuploidy, in which cells have too many or too few chromosomes. The spindle checkpoint is activated at the kinetochore and then diffuses to inhibit cell cycle progression. Although the checkpoint is active in both mitosis and meiosis, most studies involving checkpoint regulation have been performed in mitosis. By activating the spindle checkpoint in both mitosis and meiosis in budding yeast, we show that cells in meiosis elicit a less persistent checkpoint signal compared to cells in mitosis. Further, we show that cells use distinct mechanisms to escape the checkpoint in mitosis and meiosis I. While cells in mitosis and meiosis II undergo anaphase onset while retaining checkpoint proteins at the kinetochore, cells in meiosis I prematurely lose checkpoint protein localization at the kinetochore. If the mechanism to remove the checkpoint components from the kinetochore is disrupted, meiosis I cells can still escape checkpoint activity. Together, these results highlight that cell cycle checkpoints are differentially regulated during meiosis to avoid long delays and to allow gametogenesis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522494"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.01.521342", "title": "Trafficking of nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins depends on F-actin and Myosin F in Toxoplasma gondii", "authors": "Devarakonda, P.

Perturbations affecting apicoplast function leads to parasite death. To maintain a functional apicoplast, the parasite must execute two important cellular processes: accurate division of this single copy organelle into daughter parasites during cell division and trafficking of nuclear encoded apicoplast proteins (NEAT). In this study we demonstrate that F-actin and an unconventional myosin motor, TgMyoF, are important for both processes. Live cell imaging demonstrates that during division the apicoplast is highly dynamic, exhibiting branched, U-shaped and linear morphologies that are dependent on TgMyoF and actin. These dynamics appear to control apicoplast association with the centrosome and positioning of the centrosome at the apicoplast tips. Loss of apicoplast dynamics correlated with reduced apicoplast-centrosome association and ultimately apicoplast inheritance defects. In addition, we uncovered the role of TgMyoF and actin in NEAT protein trafficking. Vesicles containing the apicoplast protein APT1 were only observed during apicoplast division in control parasites, however loss of TgMyoF and actin lead to accumulation of vesicles in the cytosol, with only a small impact on vesicle movement suggesting that this actomyosin system is important for vesicle fusion with the apicoplast. Consequently, loss of TgMyoF resulted in reduced apicoplast length.

Our aim is therefore to decipher the interplay between these processes in endothelial cells exposed to atheroprone or atheroprotective shear stress.\n\nConfluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to either LSS or HSS for 24 hours. Large and small EVs were isolated from conditioned medium by sequential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. They were characterized by TEM, Western blot analysis of EV markers, tunable resistive pulse sensing, flow cytometry and proteomics. Uptake experiments were performed using fluorescently-labeled EVs and differences between groups were assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.\n\nWe found that levels of large and small EVs in HUVEC conditioned media were fifty and five times higher in HSS than in LSS conditions, respectively. In vivo and in vitro uptake experiments revealed greater EV incorporation by cells exposed to LSS conditions compared to HSS. Additionally, endothelial LSS-EVs appeared to have a greater affinity for HUVECs than HSS-EVs or EVs derived from platelets, red blood cells, granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that LSS-EVs were enriched in adhesion proteins such as PECAM1, MCAM, which were involved in EV uptake by endothelial cells. LSS-EVs also carried mitochondrial material, which may be involved in elevating reactive oxygen species levels in recipient cells.\n\nThese findings suggest that endothelial shear stress has a significant impact during EV biogenesis and uptake. Given the major role of EVs and shear stress in vascular health, deciphering the relation between these processes may yield innovative strategies for the early detection and treatment of endothelial dysfunction.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2022.12.31.522373"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.31.521737", "title": "AgamPrimer: Primer Design in Anopheles gambiae informed by range-wide genomic variation", "authors": "Nagi, S.

Such enhancers are convened to the appropriate promoter of target genes for gene regulations even though the enhancers and the promoters are apart a few mega-base pairs away from each other. In addition to physical distance, nucleotide mutations in enhancers influence a partial group of the target genes. Those make it more complicated to reveal the paired relationship between enhancer and promoter of target genes. Recently, advanced computational approaches are employed to predict such interactions. One approach requires a large number of different high-throughput datasets to predict such interactions; however, in practical aspects, all datasets for tissues and conditions of interest are not available. Whereas the alternative approach requires only genome sequences for particular predictions, their predictions are insufficient for practical applications. We address those issues by developing the digital Hi-C assay with a transformer-algorithm basis. This assay allows us to create models from simple/small/limited sequence-based datasets only. We apply the trained models to be able to identify long-distance interactions of genomic loci and three-dimensional (3D) genomic architectures in any other tissue/cell datasets; additionally, we demonstrated the predictions of genomic contexts by analysing the prediction patterns around the target locus in the three following genomic-context problems: enhancer-promoter interactions (i.e., promoter-capture Hi-C), the CTCF-enriched regions, and TAD-boundary regions.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore Cl- binding to this hydrophobic site and compare the dynamics arising when electronic polarization is neglected (CHARMM36 (c36) fixed-charge force field), included implicitly (via the prosECCo force field), or included explicitly (through the polarizable force field, AMOEBA). Free energy landscapes of Cl- moving out of the binding site and into bulk solution demonstrate that the inclusion of polarization results in stronger ion binding and a second metastable binding site in ClR. Simulations focused on this hydrophobic binding site also indicate longer binding durations and closer ion proximity when polarization is included. Furthermore, simulations reveal that Cl- within this binding site interacts with an adjacent loop to facilitate rebinding events that are not observed when polarization is neglected.

This outcome is ensured by temporally separating replicative helicase loading (G1 phase) and activation (S phase). In budding yeast, helicase loading is prevented outside of G1 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of three helicase-loading proteins: Cdc6, the Mcm2-7 helicase, and the origin recognition complex (ORC). CDK inhibition of Cdc6 and Mcm2-7 are well understood. Here we use single-molecule assays for multiple events during origin licensing to determine how CDK phosphorylation of ORC suppresses helicase loading. We find that phosphorylated ORC recruits a first Mcm2-7 to origins but prevents second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Phosphorylation of the Orc6, but not of the Orc2 subunit, increases the fraction of first Mcm2-7 recruitment events that are unsuccessful due to the rapid and simultaneous release of the helicase and its associated Cdt1 helicase-loading protein. Real-time monitoring of first Mcm2-7 ring closing reveals that either Orc2 or Orc6 phosphorylation prevents Mcm2-7 from stably encircling origin DNA. Consequently, we assessed formation of the MO complex, an intermediate that requires the closed-ring form of Mcm2-7. We found that ORC phosphorylation fully inhibits MO-complex formation and provide evidence that this event is required for stable closing of the first Mcm2-7. Our studies show that multiple steps of helicase loading are impacted by ORC phosphorylation and reveal that closing of the first Mcm2-7 ring is a two-step process started by Cdt1 release and completed by MO-complex formation.\n\nSignificance StatementEach time a eukaryotic cell divides (by mitosis) it must duplicate its chromosomal DNA exactly once to ensure that one full copy is passed to each resulting cell. Both under-replication or over-replication result in genome instability and disease or cell death. A key mechanism to prevent over-replication is the temporal separation of loading of the replicative DNA helicase at origins of replication and activation of these same helicases during the cell division cycle. Here we define the mechanism by which phosphorylation of the primary DNA binding protein involved in these events inhibits helicase loading. Our studies identify multiple steps of inhibition and provide new insights into the mechanism of helicase loading in the uninhibited condition.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522488"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.02.522381", "title": "Mechanically induced topological transition of spectrin regulates its distribution in the mammalian cortex", "authors": "Ghisleni, A.; Bonilla-Quintana, M.; Crestani, M.; Fukuzawa, A.; Rangamani, P.; Gauthier, N.", "author_corresponding": "Andrea Ghisleni", "author_corresponding_institution": "IFOM, the AIRC Institute of Moleular Oncology", "date": "2023-01-02", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "The cell cortex is a dynamic assembly that ensures cell integrity during passive deformation or active response by adapting cytoskeleton topologies with poorly understood mechanisms.

We show that hormone biosynthesis and transport are downregulated in the trophoblasts, suggesting that protective responses are promoted at the expense of decreasing other critical functions of the placenta, such as the endocrine production and the nourishment of the fetus. In addition, we pinpoint pathogen-specific effects in some placental lineages, including a strong mitochondrial alteration in the Hofbauer cells in response to T. gondii. Finally, we identify adaptive strategies and validate nutrient acquisition employed by the P. falciparum during placental malaria infection. This study provides the first detailed cellular map of the first-trimester placenta upon infection and describes the early events that may lead to fetal and placental disorders if left unchecked.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522155"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.31.522388", "title": "Additive energetic contributions of multiple peptide positions determine the relative promiscuity of viral and human sequences for PDZ domain targets", "authors": "Tahti, E.

Protein-peptide interaction surface areas are relatively small and shallow, and there are often overlapping specificities in families of peptide-binding domains. Therefore, dissecting selectivity determinants can be challenging. PDZ domains are an example of a peptide-binding domain located in several intracellular signaling and trafficking pathways, which form interactions critical for the regulation of receptor endocytic trafficking, tight junction formation, organization of supramolecular complexes in neurons, and other biological systems. These domains are also directly targeted by pathogens, and a hallmark of many oncogenic viral proteins is a PDZ-binding motif. However, amidst sequences that target PDZ domains, there is a wide spectrum in relative promiscuity. For example, the viral HPV16 E6 oncoprotein recognizes over double the number of PDZ domain-containing proteins as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the cell, despite similar PDZ targeting-sequences and identical motif residues. Here, we determine binding affinities for PDZ domains known to bind either HPV16 E6 alone or both CFTR and HPV16 E6, using peptides matching WT and hybrid sequences. We also use energy minimization to model PDZ-peptide complexes and use sequence analyses to investigate this difference. We find that while the majority of single mutations had a marginal effect on overall affinity, the additive effect on the free energy of binding accurately describes the selectivity observed. Taken together, our results describe how complex and differing PDZ interactomes can be programmed in the cell.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2022.12.31.522388"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.30.522357", "title": "Replacing continuous stimulation of one set of electrodes with successive stimulation of multiple sets of electrodes can improve the focality of transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), especially the focality of stimulation towards deep brain regions: A simulation study.", "authors": "Li, Y.; Zhang, W.", "author_corresponding": "Yixuan Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Science and Technology of China", "date": "2023-01-02", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has been proved to stimulate deep brain region while not activating the overlying cortex in the mouse brain.

We show that Debyes analysis of vant Hoffs law for osmotic equilibrium provides a consistent and plausible explanation for osmotic flow. A difference in osmolyte concentrations in solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane generates different pressures at the two water-membrane interfaces.

Here, we evaluate both the theoretical basis and practical implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method is highly-conservative, and therefore, unlikely to mischaracterize reads as spliced (mature) or unspliced (nascent) when they are not. However, we find that it leaves a large fraction of reads classified as ambiguous, and, in practice, allocates these ambiguous reads in an all-or-nothing manner, and differently between single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Further, as implemented in practice, the ambiguous classification is implicit and based on the index against which the reads are mapped, which leads to several drawbacks compared to methods that consider both spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) mapping targets simultaneously -- for example, the ability to use confidently assigned reads to rescue ambiguous reads based on shared UMIs and gene targets. Nonetheless, we show that these conservative assignment rules can be obtained directly in existing approaches simply by altering the set of targets that are indexed. To this end, we introduce the spliceu reference and show that its use with alevin-fry recapitulates the more conservative proposed classification.\n\nWe also observe that, on experimental data, and under the proposed allocation rules for ambiguous UMIs, the difference between the proposed classification scheme and existing conventions appears much smaller than previously reported. We demonstrate the use of the new piscem index for mapping simultaneously against spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) targets, allowing classification against the full nascent and mature transcriptome in human or mouse in <3GB of memory.

We examined the folding landscape of monomeric caspases from two coral species over a broad pH range of 3 to 10.5. On an evolutionary timescale, the two coral caspases diverged from each other approximately 300 million years ago, and they diverged from human caspases about 600 million years ago. Our results indicate that both proteins have overall high stability, [~] 15 kcal mol-1 near the physiological pH range (pH 6 to pH 8), and unfold via two partially folded intermediates, I1 and I2, that are in equilibrium with the native and the unfolded state. Like the dimeric caspases, the monomeric coral caspases undergo a pH-dependent conformational change resulting from the titration of an evolutionarily conserved site. Data from molecular dynamics simulations paired with limited proteolysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry show that the small subunit of the monomeric caspases is unstable and unfolds prior to the large subunit. Overall, the data suggest that all caspases share a conserved folding landscape, that a conserved allosteric site can be fine-tuned for species-specific regulation, and that the subfamily of stable dimers may have evolved to stabilize the small subunit.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2023.01.04.522771"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.04.522776", "title": "The assembly landscape of the complete B-repeat superdomain from Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1457", "authors": "Yarawsky, A.

The B-repeat superdomain is responsible for intercellular adhesion that leads to the development of biofilms occurring in such infections. It was recently demonstrated that Zn-induced B-repeat assembly leads to formation of functional amyloid fibrils, which offer strength and stability to the biofilm. Rigorous biophysical studies of Aap B-repeats from S. epidermidis strain RP62A revealed Zn-induced assembly into a stable, reversible dimer and tetramer, prior to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Genetic manipulation is not tractable for many S. epidermidis strains, including RP62A; instead, many genetic studies have used strain 1457. Therefore, to better connect findings from biophysical and structural studies of B-repeats to in vivo studies, the B-repeat superdomain from strain 1457 was examined. Differences between the B-repeats from strain RP62A and 1457 include the number of B-repeats, which has been shown to play a critical role in assembly into amyloid fibrils, as well as the distribution of consensus and variant B-repeat subtypes, which differ in assembly competency and thermal stability. Detailed investigation of the Zn-induced assembly of the full B-repeat supderdomain from strain 1457 was conducted using analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas the previous construct from RP62A (Brpt5.5) formed a stable tetramer prior to aggregation, Brpt6.5 from 1457 forms extremely large stable species on the order of 28- and 32-mers, prior to aggregation into similar amyloid fibrils. Importantly, both assembly pathways proceed through the same mechanism of dimerization and tetramerization, and both conclude with the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. Theoretical discussions of the energy landscape of B-repeats from different strains and of different length are provided with considerations of biological implications.\n\nStatement of SignificanceStaphylococcus epidermidis is a major pathogen responsible for device-related infections. The primary factor responsible for such infections is the accumulation-associated protein, Aap, through its ability to mediate formation of dense surface-adherent communities of bacteria known as biofilms. Our lab recently demonstrated that the B-repeat superdomain of Aap from strain RP62A undergoes Zn-dependent assembly to form functional amyloid fibrils that improve the strength and resilience of biofilms in vitro. These amyloid fibrils may be responsible for the difficulty in treating device-related infections. However, strain 1457 is commonly used for genetic manipulation. In this manuscript, the Zn-dependent assembly of B-repeats from strain 1457 is shown to lead to the same outcome of amyloidogenesis, although it occurs through different intermediate oligomeric states.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2023.01.04.522776"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.04.522768", "title": "Wetting by biomolecular condensates increases membrane lipid packing and dehydration", "authors": "Mangiarotti, A.; Siri, M.; Zhao, Z.; Malacrida, L.; Dimova, R.", "author_corresponding": "Agustin Mangiarotti", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces", "date": "2023-01-04", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Membrane wetting by biomolecular condensates recently emerged as a critical phenomenon in cell biology, involved in a great diversity of processes across different organisms.

Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy and data analysis pipeline, named Simultaneous Proteome Localization and Turnover (SPLAT), to measure concurrently the changes in protein turnover and subcellular distribution in the same experiment. Investigating two common UPR models of thapsigargin and tunicamycin challenge, we find that the global suppression of protein synthesis during UPR is dependent on subcellular localization, with more severe slowdown in lysosome vs. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein turnover. Most candidate translocation events affect pre-existing proteins and likely involve vesicular transport across endomembrane fractions including an expansion of an ER-derived vesicle (ERV) compartment containing RNA binding proteins and stress response proteins. In parallel, we observed specific translocations involving only newly synthesized protein pools that are indicative of endomembrane stalling. The translocation of a subclass of cell surface proteins to the endomembrane including EGFR and ITGAV upon UPR affects only heavy labeled proteins, which suggest their internalization is driven by nascent protein trafficking rather than ligand dependent endocytosis.

Selective breeding using genomic selection has potential to achieve cumulative improvement of host resistance. However, genomic selection is expensive partly due to the cost of genotyping high numbers of animals using high-density SNP arrays. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of genomic selection for resistance to F. columnare using in silico low-density (LD) panels combined with imputation. After a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 2,874 challenged fish and 469 fish from the parental generation (n=81 parents) were genotyped with 27,907 SNPs. The efficiency of genomic prediction using LD-panels was assessed for panels of 10 different densities, created in silico using two sampling methods, random and equally spaced. All LD-panels were also imputed to the full 28K HD-panel using the parental generation as the reference population, and genomic predictions were reevaluated. The potential of prioritizing SNPs showing association with resistance to F. columnare was also tested for the six lower densities.\n\nResultsSimilar results were obtained with random and equally spaced sampling of SNPs for accuracy of both imputation and genomic predictions.

Tetracationic metallo-supramolecular pillarplexes display aryl faces about a cylindrical core giving them an ideal structure to interact with the central cavities of open DNA junctions. Combining experimental studies and MD simulations we show that an Au pillarplex can bind DNA 4-way junctions (Holliday junctions) in their open form, a binding mode not accessed by synthetic agents before. The Au pillarplexes can bind designed 3-way junctions too but their large size leads them to open up and expand that junction, disrupting the base pairing which manifests in an increase in hydrodynamic size and a lower junction thermal stability. At high loading they re-arrange both 4-way and 3-way junctions into Y-shaped DNA forks to increase the available junction-like binding sites. The structurally related Ag pillarplexes show similar DNA junction binding behaviour, but a lower solution stability. This pillarplex binding contrasts with (but complements) that of the metallo-supramolecular cylinders, which prefer 3-way junctions and we show can rearrange 4-way junctions into 3-way junction structures. The pillarplexes ability to bind open 4-way junctions creates exciting possibilities to modulate and switch such structures in biology, as well as in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures where they are key interconnecting components. Studies in human cells, confirm that the pillarplexes do reach the nucleus, with antiproliferative activity at levels similar to those of cisplatin. The findings provide a new roadmap for targeting higher order junction structures using a metallo-supramolecular approach, as well as expanding the toolbox available to design bioactive junction-binders into organometallic chemistry.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522759v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10fac36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f32f9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb8d72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1433de5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2023.01.04.522759"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.04.522722", "title": "Generalized tree structure to annotate untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing data", "authors": "Li, S.; Zheng, S.", "author_corresponding": "Shuzhao Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine", "date": "2023-01-04", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "In untargeted metabolomics, multiple ions are often measured for each original metabolite, including isotopic forms and in-source modifications, such as adducts and fragments.

Here, we use a supported lipid bilayer platform in tandem with total internal reflection microscopy to observe the 2-dimensional movement of DNA and nucleosomes at the single-molecule resolution. This dimensional reduction from 3-dimensional studies allows us to observe the initial condensation events and dissolution of these early condensates in the presence of physiological condensing agents. Using polyamines, we observed that the initial condensation happens on a timescale of minutes while dissolution occurs within seconds upon charge inversion. Polyamine valency, DNA length and GC content affect threshold polyamine concentration for condensation. Protein-based nucleosome condensing agents, HP1 and Ki-67, have much lower threshold concentration for condensation than charge-based condensing agents, with Ki-67 being the most effective as low as 100 pM for nucleosome condensation. In addition, we did not observe condensate dissolution even at the highest concentrations of HP1 and Ki-67 tested. We also introduce a two-color imaging scheme where nucleosomes of high density labeled in one color is used to demarcate condensate boundaries and identical nucleosomes of another color at low density can be tracked relative to the boundaries after Ki-67 mediated condensation.

When reconstituted in vitro, these cytoskeletal proteins serve as energy-consuming building blocks to study the self-organization of active matter. Cytoskeletal active gels display rich emergent dynamics, including extensile chaotic flows, locally contractile asters, and bulk contraction. However, it is unclear which protein-scale interactions, if any, set the contractile or extensile nature of the active gel, or how to control the transition from one phase to another in a simple active system. Here, we explore the microscopic origin of the extensile-to-contractile transition in a reconstituted active material composed of stabilized microtubules, depletant, ATP, and clusters of kinesin-1 motors. We show that microscopic interactions between highly processive motor clusters and microtubules can trigger the end-accumulation of motor proteins, which in turn drives polarity sorting and aster formation. Combining experiments and simple scaling arguments, we demonstrate that the extensile-to-contractile transition is akin to a self-assembly process where nematic and polar aligning interactions compete. We identify a single control parameter given by the ratio of the different component concentrations that dictates the material-scale organization into either a contractile aster or an extensile bundle. Overall, this work shows that robust self-organization of cytoskeletal active materials can be controlled by precise biochemical and mechanical tuning at the microscopic level.\n\nSignificance statementSelf-organization in living cells is often driven by energy-consuming motor proteins that push and pull on a network of cytoskeletal filaments. However, it is unclear how to connect the emergent structure and dynamics of reconstituted cytoskeletal materials to the properties of their microscopic building blocks.

Barring a few specific cases, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs remain poorly understood. Transcriptional proteins can form condensates via phase separation at protein-binding loci (BL) on the genome (e.g., enhancers and promoters). lncRNA-coding genes are present at loci in close genomic proximity of these BL and these RNAs can interact with transcriptional proteins via attractive heterotypic interactions mediated by their net charge. Motivated by these observations, we propose that lncRNAs can dynamically regulate transcription in cis via charge-based heterotypic interactions with transcriptional proteins in condensates. To study the consequences of this mechanism, we developed and studied a dynamical phase-field model. We find that proximal lncRNAs can promote condensate formation at the BL. Vicinally localized lncRNA can migrate to the BL to attract more protein because of favorable interaction free energies. However, increasing the distance beyond a threshold leads to a sharp decrease in protein recruitment to the BL. This finding could potentially explain why genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes and protein-coding genes are conserved across metazoans. Finally, our model predicts that lncRNA transcription can fine-tune transcription from neighboring condensate-controlled genes, repressing transcription from highly expressed genes and enhancing transcription of genes expressed at a low level. This non-equilibrium effect can reconcile conflicting reports that lncRNAs can enhance or repress transcription from proximal genes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCELong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form a significant part of the human genome but do not code for any proteins. They have many hypothesized functions in the cell, including the regulation of transcription. Transcriptional condensates are assemblies of transcriptional proteins that concentrate at specific genomic sites through phase separation and can regulate transcription. In this study, we propose that lncRNAs can regulate transcription by interacting with proteins in transcriptional condensates to modulate condensate formation. We find that this model can explain some puzzling observations such as conflicting reports of gene activation and repression by lncRNAs, and conservation of genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes relative to protein-coding genes in metazoans.

Herein we describe the utilization of CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging (SMI) to interrogate transcriptomic changes associated with the transition from the obese, prediabetic state to overt type 2 diabetes. Using SMI, we verified previously reported findings regarding islet composition in the obese and type 2 diabetic states, including loss of beta cells and expansion of alpha cell mass. In addition, we identified changes in the islet neighborhood that have implications for the function of islet endocrine cells. In particular, we identified a subset of alpha cells oriented in the periphery of the islets that appear to exhibit a transcriptomic profile suggestive of de-differentiation toward a beta cell-like transcriptome-type.

Herein, we show that inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with MS023 increases the proliferative capacity of ex vivo cultured MuSCs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ex vivo cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of novel subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically reprogrammed with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed more robustly to muscle regeneration following injury.

Here, we report that non-cytotoxic concentrations (< 500 nM) of Gaudichaudione H (GH, isolated from Garcinia oligantha Merr.) potently inhibits HSV-1 replication in vitro without affecting viral entry or attachment.

Previously, we reported the first S. mutans negative selection system that functions in a wild-type background. This system utilizes induced sensitivity to the toxic amino acid analog p-chlorophenylalanine (4-CP) as a negative selection mechanism, and was developed for counterselection-based cloning-independent markerless mutagenesis (CIMM). While we have employed this system extensively for our ongoing genetic studies, we have encountered a couple limitations with the system, mainly its narrow host range and the requirement for selection on a toxic substrate. Here, we report the development of a new negative selection system that addresses both limitations, while still retaining the utility of the previous 4-CP-based markerless mutagenesis system. We placed a variety of toxin-encoding genes under the control of the xylose-inducible Xyl-S expression cassette and found the Fst-sm and ParE toxins to be suitable candidates for inducible negative selection. We combined the inducible toxins with an antibiotic resistance gene to create several different counterselection cassettes. The most broadly useful of these contained a wild-type fst-sm open reading frame transcriptionally fused to a point mutant form of the Xyl-S expression system, which we subsequently named as IFDC4. IFDC4 was shown to exhibit exceptionally low background resistance, with 3 - 4 log reductions in cell number observed when plating on xylose-supplemented media. IFDC4 also functioned similarly in multiple strains of S. mutans as well as with S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. We performed CIMM with IFDC4 and successfully engineered a variety of different types of markerless mutations in all three species. The counterselection strategy described here provides a template approach that should be adaptable for the creation of similar counterselection systems in many other bacteria.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.03.522674"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.06.522876", "title": "Surface frustration re-patterning underlies the structural landscape and evolvability of fungal orphan candidate effectors", "authors": "Derbyshire, M.

Effectors are engaged in a molecular arms race with the host resulting in conflicting evolutionary constraints to manipulate host cells without triggering immune responses.

Here, we show that 62 conserved structure-related families encompass the majority of fungal orphan effector candidates at the subphylum level. These effectors diversified through changes in patterns of thermodynamic frustration at surface residues. The underlying mutations tended to increase the robustness of the overall effector protein structure while switching potential binding interfaces.

This stems, at least in part, from strong abilities to form biofilms on abiotic or biotic surfaces. Biofilms are well-organized multicellular aggregates of bacteria, which, when formed on indwelling medical devices, lead to infections that are difficult to treat. Cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins are known to be important players in biofilm formation and infection. Many of these proteins have putative stalk-like regions or regions of low complexity near the cell wall-anchoring motif. Recent work demonstrated the strong propensity of the stalk region of the S. epidermidis accumulation-associated protein (Aap) to remain highly extended under solution conditions that typically induce compaction or other significant conformational changes. This behavior is consistent with the expected function of a stalk-like region that is covalently attached to the cell wall peptidoglycan and projects the adhesive domains of Aap away from the cell surface. In this study, we evaluate whether the ability to resist compaction is a common theme among stalk regions from various staphylococcal CWA proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine secondary structure changes as a function of temperature and cosolvents along with sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS to characterize structural characteristics in solution. All stalk regions tested are intrinsically disordered, lacking secondary structure beyond random coil and polyproline type II helix, and they all sample highly extended conformations. Remarkably, the Ser-Asp dipeptide repeat region of SdrC exhibited nearly identical behavior in solution when compared to the Aap Pro/Gly-rich region, despite highly divergent sequence patterns, indicating conservation of function by various distinct staphylococcal CWA protein stalk regions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.06.523059"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.07.522792", "title": "Passive endocytosis in protocells enables nutrient transport bypassing permeability limits", "authors": "Zhang, S.

Molecules that are too impermeable to be absorbed can be captured in a matter of seconds in an endocytic vesicle. These internalized molecules can then be slowly released over hours, into the main lumen or putative cytoplasm.

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce HiDDEN, a computational method that refines the case-control labels to accurately reflect the perturbation status of each cell. We show HiDDENs superior ability to recover biological signals missed by the standard analysis workflow in simulated ground truth datasets of cell type mixtures. When applied to a dataset of human multiple myeloma precursor conditions, HiDDEN recapitulates the expert manual annotation and discovers malignancy in previously considered healthy early stage samples.

Previous work has demonstrated that supervised machine learning methods applied to such networks can identify drug repurposing opportunities. However, a training set of known relationships does not exist for many types of node pairs, even when it would be useful to examine how nodes of those types are meaningfully connected. For example, users may be curious not only how metformin is related to breast cancer, but also how the GJA1 gene might be involved in insomnia. We developed a new procedure, termed hetnet connectivity search, that proposes important paths between any two nodes without requiring a supervised gold standard. The algorithm behind connectivity search identifies types of paths that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (based on node degree alone). We find that predictions are broadly similar to those from previously described supervised approaches for certain node type pairs. Scoring of individual paths is based on the most specific paths of a given type. Several optimizations were required to precompute significant instances of node connectivity at the scale of large knowledge graphs.

In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.06.522937"}]
