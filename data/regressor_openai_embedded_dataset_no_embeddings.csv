With the rapid growth in scRNA-seq datasets, there is a need to simplify and systematize this process.

ResultsWe introduce UNCURL-App, an online GUI-based interactive tool which integrates the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline with prior knowledge. UNCURL-App introduces two key innovations: First, cell type databases are integrated directly with the rest of the analysis process, allowing the user to identify potential cell types or pathways directly from the data. Second, tools for interactive re-analysis allow the user to create, merge, or delete clusters. In addition, UNCURL-App integrates multiple stages of the data analysis pipeline into a single interface, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression, and cell type identification.

AvailabilityThe web tool is available at https://uncurl.cs.washington.edu/. Source code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_app

Therefore, low-abundant RNAs compete against highly abundant - and sometimes non-informative - RNA species. We developed an easy-to-use strategy based on high-affinity RNA-binding oligonucleotides to block reverse transcription and PCR amplification of specific RNA transcripts, thereby substantially reducing their abundance in the final sequencing library. To demonstrate the broad application potential of our method, we applied it to different transcripts and library preparation strategies, including YRNAs in small RNA sequencing of human blood plasma, mitochondrial rRNAs in both 3 end sequencing and long-read sequencing, and MALAT1 in single-cell 3 end sequencing. We demonstrate that the blocking strategy is highly efficient, reproducible, specific, and generally results in better transcriptome coverage and complexity.

D.; Sahlin, K.",Kristoffer Sahlin,Stockholm University,2023-01-03,bioinformatics,"In sequence similarity search applications such as read mapping, it is desired that seeds match between a read and reference in regions with mutations or read errors (seed sensitivity). K-mers are likely the most well-known and used seed construct in bioinformatics, and many studies on, e.g., spaced k-mers aim to improve sensitivity over k-mers. Spaced k-mers are highly sensitive when substitutions largely dominate the mutation rate but quickly deteriorate when indels are present. Recently, we developed a pseudo-random seeding construct, strobemers, which were empirically demonstrated to have high sensitivity also at high indel rates. However, the study lacked a deeper understanding of why. In this study, we demonstrate that a seeds entropy (randomness) is a good predictor for seed sensitivity. We propose a model to estimate the entropy of a seed and find that seeds with high entropy, according to our model, in most cases have high match sensitivity. We also present three new strobemer seed constructs, mixedstrobes, altstrobes, and multistrobes. We use both simulated and biological data to demonstrate that our new seed constructs improve sequence-matching sensitivity to other strobemers. We implement strobemers into minimap2 and observe slightly faster alignment time and higher accuracy than using k-mers at various error rates.

Our discovered seed randomness-sensitivity relationship explains why some seeds perform better than others, and the relationship provides a framework for designing even more sensitive seeds.

In this paper, we treat the GWAS summary information obtained in the base data as knowledge learned from a pre-trained model, and adopt a transfer learning framework to effectively leverage the knowledge learned from the base data that may or may not have similar ancestral background as the target samples to build prediction models for target individuals. Our proposed transfer learning framework consists of two main steps: (1) conducting false negative control (FNC) marginal screening to extract useful knowledge from the base data; and (2) performing joint model training to integrate the knowledge extracted from base data with the target training data for accurate trans-data prediction. This new approach can significantly enhance the computational and statistical efficiency of joint-model training, alleviate over-fitting, and facilitate more accurate trans-data prediction when heterogeneity level between target and base data sets is small or high.

The g-ratio is the gold standard measure of assessing myelin thickness and quality, and traditionally is determined from measurements done manually from EM images - a time-consuming endeavour with limited reproducibility. These measurements have also historically neglected the innermost uncompacted myelin sheath, known as the inner myelin tongue. Nonetheless, the inner tongue has been shown to be important for myelin growth and some studies have reported that certain conditions can elicit its enlargement. Ignoring this fact may bias the standard g-ratio analysis, whereas quantifying the uncompacted myelin has the potential to provide novel insights in the myelin field. In this regard, we have developed AimSeg, a bioimage analysis tool for axon, inner tongue and myelin segmentation. Aided by machine learning classifiers trained on tissue undergoing remyelination, AimSeg can be used either as an automated workflow or as a user-assisted segmentation tool. Validation results show good performance segmenting all three fibre components, with the assisted segmentation showing the potential for further improvement with minimal user intervention. This results in a considerable reduction in time for analysis compared with manual annotation. AimSeg could also be used to build larger, high quality ground truth datasets to train novel deep learning models. Implemented in Fiji, AimSeg can use machine learning classifiers trained in ilastik. This, combined with a user-friendly interface and the ability to quantify uncompacted myelin, makes AimSeg a unique tool to assess myelin growth.

Author SummaryMyelin is formed by specialised cells that wrap themselves around axons and has a major role in the function, protection, and maintenance of nerves. These functions are disturbed by demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this work we present AimSeg, a new tool based on artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning) to assess myelin growth on electron microscopy images. Whereas standard metrics and previous computational methods focus on quantifying compact myelin, AimSeg also quantifies the inner myelin tongue (uncompacted myelin). This structure has been largely overlooked despite the fact that it has an important role in the process of myelin growth (both during development and in the adult brain) and recent studies have reported morphological changes associated with some diseases. We report the performance of AimSeg, both as a fully automated approach and in an assisted segmentation workflow that enables the user to curate the results on-the-fly while reducing human intervention to the minimum. Therefore, AimSeg stands as a novel bioimage analysis tool that meets the challenges of assessing myelin growth by supporting both standard metrics for myelin evaluation and the quantification of the uncompacted myelin in different conditions.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.02.522533,"Title: AimSeg: a machine-learning-aided tool for axon, inner tongue and myelin segmentation; Authors: Rondelli, A.

The g-ratio is the gold standard measure of assessing myelin thickness and quality, and traditionally is determined from measurements done manually from EM images - a time-consuming endeavour with limited reproducibility. These measurements have also historically neglected the innermost uncompacted myelin sheath, known as the inner myelin tongue. Nonetheless, the inner tongue has been shown to be important for myelin growth and some studies have reported that certain conditions can elicit its enlargement.

H.",Oscar Herminio Bastidas,Virginia Commonwealth University,2023-01-03,biophysics,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to viral infection of host cells which ultimately results in COVID-19. In this study we analyze the behavior of dihedral (phi and psi) angles of the spike protein over time from molecular dynamics and identify that the oscillations of these dihedral angles are dominated by a few discrete, relatively low frequencies in the 23-63 MHz range with 42.96875 MHz being the most prevalent frequency sampled by the oscillations. We further observe that upon tallying the populations of each individual frequency for all residues along the frequency spectrum, there is a regular alternation between high and low population counts along the increasing frequency values in the spectrum. This alternation of the counts becomes less pronounced and ultimately stabilizes as the frequency values increase. These observations thus suggest a regularity and propensity in the spike proteins dihedral angles to avoid similar oscillation population counts between vicinal frequencies. We also observe that for amino acids that are least abundant in the S protein, there are certain frequencies at which the dihedral angles never oscillate, in contrast to relatively abundant amino acids that ultimately cover the entire spectrum. This suggests that the frequency components of dihedral angle oscillations may also be a function of position in the primary structure: the more positions an amino acid is found in, the more frequencies it can sample. Lastly, certain residues identified in the literature as constituting the inside of a druggable pocket of the spike protein, as well as other residues identified as allosteric sites, are observed in our data to have distinctive time domain profiles. This motivates us to propose residues from our dynamic data, with similar time domain profiles, which may be of potential interest to the vaccine and drug design communities, for further investigation.

For the human muscarinic receptor 3 (hMR3), tiotropium is a long-acting bronchodylator used in conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanistic insights of this inhibitor remain unclear, specifically, elucidation of the main factors determining the unbinding rates could help develop the next generation of antimuscarinic agents. Using our novel unbinding algorithm, we were able to investigate ligand dissociation from hMR3. The unbinding paths of tiotropium and two of its analogues, N-methylscopolamin and homatropine methylbromide show a consistent qualitative mechanism and allowed us to identify the structural bottleneck of the process. Furthermore, our machine learning-based analysis identified key roles of the ECL2/TM5 junction involved at the transition state. Additionally, our results point at relevant changes at the intracellular end of the TM6 helix leading to the ICL3 kinase domain, highlighting the closest residue L482. This residue is located right between two main protein binding sites involved in signal transduction for hMR3s activation and regulation. We also highlight key pharmacophores of tiotropium that play determining roles in the unbinding kinetics and could aid towards drug design and lead optimization.

J.; Gehrke, S.; Badaoui, M.; Mandana, G.; Qi, T.; Bottegoni, G.; Rosta, E.; Corresponding Author: Edina Rosta; Author Institution: University College London; Category: biophysics; Abstract: Patient symptom relief is often heavily influenced by the residence time of the inhibitor-target complex. For the human muscarinic receptor 3 (hMR3), tiotropium is a long-acting bronchodylator used in conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanistic insights of this inhibitor remain unclear, specifically, elucidation of the main factors determining the unbinding rates could help develop the next generation of antimuscarinic agents. Using our novel unbinding algorithm, we were able to investigate ligand dissociation from hMR3. The unbinding paths of tiotropium and two of its analogues, N-methylscopolamin and homatropine methylbromide show a consistent qualitative mechanism and allowed us to identify the structural bottleneck of the process. Furthermore, our machine learning-based analysis identified key roles of the ECL2/TM5 junction involved at the transition state. Additionally, our results point at relevant changes at the intracellular end of the TM6 helix leading to the ICL3 kinase domain, highlighting the closest residue L482. This residue is located right between two main protein binding sites involved in signal transduction for hMR3s activation and regulation. We also highlight key pharmacophores of tiotropium that play determining roles in the unbinding kinetics and could aid towards drug design and lead optimization.

In this study, we systematically tested the NET in a disc by variation of the escape opening. Our model system consisted of micro-patterned lipid bilayers.

Significance StatementIn the biological context of a cell, a multitude of reactions are facilitated by diffusion. It is astonishing how Brownian motion as a cost-efficient but random process is mediating especially fast reactions. The formalism of the narrow escape theory is a tool to determine the average timescale of such processes to be completed (mean first passage time, MFPT) from the reaction space and diffusion coefficient. We present the systematic proof of this formalism experimentally in a bio-mimetic model system and by random walk simulations. Further, we demonstrate a straightforward solution to determine the MFPT from incomplete experimental traces. This will be beneficial for measurements of the MFPT, reliant on fluorescent probes, that have prior been inaccessible.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.03.521408,"Title: Experiments in micro-patterned model membranes support the narrow escape theory; Authors: Meiser, E.; Mohammadi, R.; Vogel, N.; Holcman, D.; Fenz, S.

To conclude, we confirmed the NET prediction in vitro and in silico for the disc geometry in the limit of small escape openings.

Significance StatementIn the biological context of a cell, a multitude of reactions are facilitated by diffusion. It is astonishing how Brownian motion as a cost-efficient but random process is mediating especially fast reactions. The formalism of the narrow escape theory is a tool to determine the average timescale of such processes to be completed (mean first passage time, MFPT) from the reaction space and diffusion coefficient. We present the systematic proof of this formalism experimentally in a bio-mimetic model system and by random walk simulations. Further, we demonstrate a straightforward solution to determine the MFPT from incomplete experimental traces. This will be beneficial for measurements of the MFPT, reliant on fluorescent probes, that have prior been inaccessible.",418

Starting from a library containing billions of random variants, DE screens them against a chosen task over multiple rounds until they converge onto a few variants with desired properties. Today, DE benefits from deep sequencing, allowing us to monitor millions of distinct variants through the screening iterations. Nevertheless deep sequencing data are noisy and it is often difficult to understand if the selection process has yet converged onto reliable results. As a consequence, experimentalists are compelled to increase the number of selection rounds or even to replicate the experiments. Here, we propose ACIDES (Accurate Confidence Intervals to rank Directed Evolution Scores), a combination of statistical inference and in-silico simulations to: (i) reliably estimate the selectivity of individual variants and its statistical error using the data from all available rounds; (ii) identify which variants among the best ones are worth keeping for further tests; (iii) quantify if DE has converged onto the few variants with desired function or if additional experimental rounds/replicates or deep sequencing are needed. The latter point allows for integrating ACIDES into the experimental pipeline to avoid unnecessary, costly and time-consuming experimental efforts.

However, a recent study questioned the origin of these cells, suggesting that resident liver progenitor cells, but not hepatocytes, proliferate. Here, we provide lineage tracing-based evidence that adult hepatocytes acquire proliferative capacity in vitro. Unexpectedly, we also found that the CLiP method allows biliary epithelial cells to acquire extensive proliferative capacity. Interestingly, after long-term culture, hepatocyte-derived cells (hepCLiPs) and biliary-derived cells (bilCLiPs) become similar in their gene expression patterns, and they both exhibit differentiation capacity to form hepatocyte-like cells. Finally, we provide evidence that hepCLiPs can repopulate chronically injured mouse livers, reinforcing our earlier argument that CLiPs can be a cell source for liver regenerative medicine. Moreover, this study offers bilCLiPs as a potential cell source for liver regenerative medicine.",304

The goal of this paper was to understand and assess the physiological stressors that might underlie coral fragment cryopreservation and the long-term consequences of these physiological exposures to continued growth. Therefore, we assessed small fragments ([~]0.5 x0.5 mm2) from the Hawaiian coral, Porites compressa, examining: 1) the sensitivity of the fragments and their algal symbionts to chilling temperatures; 2) the sensitivity of the coral to complex cryoprotectants; 3) methods to safely remove the algal symbionts from the coral fragment for cryopreservation, given the two symbiotic partners may require different cryopreservation protocols; 4) continued growth over time of coral fragments once returned to running seawater after treatment exposures; and, 5) assessment of health and viability of microfragments after treatments examining the distribution of green fluorescent protein and fluorescent symbionts.
