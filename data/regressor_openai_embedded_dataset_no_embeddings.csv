It is a mathematically rigorous approach to combine short exact matches.

However, developing extensions of chaining algorithms for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been challenging. Recently, a new sparse dynamic programming framework was introduced that exploits small path cover of pangenome reference DAGs, and enables efficient chaining [Makinen et al. TALG19, RECOMB18].

Misrepresenting these relationships may lead to the erroneous prediction of e.g. disease spread, drug delivery, and nerve injury in the brain. However, understanding fluid-neuron interactions is an outstanding challenge because the behaviours of both phases are not only dynamic but also occur at an extremely small length scale (the width of flow channel is [~]100 nm), which cannot be captured by the state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Here, by explicitly simulating dynamics of the flow and axons at the microstructural level, we, for the first time, establish the link between micromechanical tissue response to the physical laws governing the macroscopic transport property of the brain white matter. We found that interactions between axons and the interstitial flow is very strong, thus playing an essential role in the brain fluid/mass transport. Furthermore, we proposed the first anisotropic pressure-dependent permeability tensor informed by microstructural dynamics for more accurate brain modelling at the macroscale, and analysed the effect of the variation of the microstructural parameters that influence such tensor.

Humphrey,Yale University,2023-01-08,bioengineering,"Children born with single ventricle defects undergo staged palliative surgeries to reconstruct the circulation to improve transport of deoxygenated blood to the lungs. As part of the first surgery, a temporary shunt (Blalock-Thomas-Taussig) is often created in neonates to connect a systemic and a pulmonary artery. Standard-of-care shunts are synthetic, which can lead to thrombosis, and much stiffer than the two host vessels, which can cause adverse mechanobiological responses.

As part of the first surgery, a temporary shunt (Blalock-Thomas-Taussig) is often created in neonates to connect a systemic and a pulmonary artery. Standard-of-care shunts are synthetic, which can lead to thrombosis, and much stiffer than the two host vessels, which can cause adverse mechanobiological responses.

Experimental panel assay protocols are routinely used as a standard procedure to evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of a drug candidate to target kinase. However, current kinase panel assays are time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the panel assay protocols neither provide insights on binding sites nor allow experiments on mutated sequences or newly-characterized kinases. Existing virtual screening or docking simulation technologies require extensive computational resources, thus it is not practical to use them for the panel of kinases. With rapid advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies, a number of DTI tools have been developed over the years. However, these methods are yet to achieve prediction accuracies at the level of practical use. In addition, the performances of current DTI tools vary significantly depending on test sets. In this case, an ensemble model can be used to improve and stabilize DTI prediction accuracies.

ResultsIn this work, we propose an ensemble model, EnsDTI-kinase, that integrates eight existing machine learning and deep learning models into a unified model deployed as a web-server. Upon submission of a compound SMILES string, potential target kinases are automatically predicted and evaluated on the web-server. Importantly, EnsDTI-kinase is a computational platform where newly developed DTI tools can be easily incorporated without modifying core components so that its DTI prediction quality can improve over time. Besides, many useful functionalities are provided on our platform for users to further investigate predicted DTI: it allows confidence experiments by changing the amino acid (AA) at a specific position in a kinase sequence, named in silico mutagenesis, to investigate the effect of AA changes in binding affinity; it predicts kinase sequential regions where the query compound likely binds to by slidingly masking the sequence of selected kinases so that confidence in the predicted binding sites can be evaluated. Our model was evaluated in three experimental settings using four independent datasets, and showed accuracy of 0.82 compared to the average accuracy of 0.69 from five deep learning methods on the ChEMBL dataset. It achieved average selectivity of 0.95 within kinase families such as TK, CAMK and STE. For 8 out of 17 recent drugs, our model successfully predicted their interactions with 404 proteins at average accuracy of 0.82.

However, the role of human-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in VSMC inflammation is poorly understood.

MethodsBulk RNA-seq in differentiated human VSMCs revealed a novel human-specific lncRNA called INflammatory MKL1 Interacting Long Noncoding RNA (INKILN). INKILN expression was assessed in multiple in vitro and ex vivo models of VSMC phenotypic modulation and human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) samples. The transcriptional regulation of INKILN was determined through luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Both loss- and gain-of-function approaches and multiple RNA-protein and protein-protein interaction assays were utilized to uncover the role of INKILN in VSMC proinflammatory gene program and underlying mechanisms. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) transgenic (Tg) mice were utilized to study INKLIN expression and function in ligation injury-induced neointimal formation.

ResultsINKILN expression is downregulated in contractile VSMCs and induced by human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. INKILN is transcriptionally activated by the p65 pathway, partially through a predicted NF-{kappa}B site within its proximal promoter. INKILN activates the proinflammatory gene expression in cultured human VSMCs and ex vivo cultured vessels. Mechanistically, INKILN physically interacts with and stabilizes MKL1, a key activator of VSMC inflammation through the p65/NF-{kappa}B pathway. INKILN depletion blocks ILI{beta}-induced nuclear localization of both p65 and MKL1. Knockdown of INKILN abolishes the physical interaction between p65 and MKL1, and the luciferase activity of an NF-{kappa}B reporter. Further, INKILN knockdown enhances MKL1 ubiquitination, likely through the reduced physical interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP10. INKILN is induced in injured carotid arteries and exacerbates ligation injury-induced neointimal formation in BAC Tg mice.

Summary StatementWe identified a variant in KLC4 associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. The variant had physiological relevance in a humanized C. elegans model where we replaced klc-2 with human KLC4.",405

To improve the genomic resources in popcorn, a panel of 362 popcorn accessions was evaluated using 417,218 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Using this genomic data, a model-based clustering analysis identified two populations. The first comprised North American Yellow Pearl Popcorns and several accessions of the Chilean Curagua landrace. The second, the Pointed and Latin American Popcorns, included all remaining North American (pointed and early popcorns), Latin American, and global accessions. The two populations exhibited large differences in population structure and genetic diversity. The North American Yellow Pearl Popcorns constitute a highly inbred population with limited genetic diversity compared to the Pointed and Latin American Popcorns. Additionally, phenotypic differences between the two populations were observed in kernel color and nicosulfuron sensitivity.

Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated its effects on bone tissue, which were also notably predicted in the mechanostat theory. Indeed, existing methods to quantify bone mechanoregulation have successfully associated the frequency of remodeling events with local mechanical signals, combining time-lapsed in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging and micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis. However, a correlation between the local surface velocity of remodeling events and mechanical signals has not been shown. As many degenerative bone diseases have also been linked to impaired bone remodeling, this relationship could provide an advantage in detecting the effects of such conditions and advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel method to estimate remodeling velocity (RmV) curves from time-lapsed in vivo mouse caudal vertebrae data under static and cyclic mechanical loading. These curves can be fitted with piecewise linear functions as proposed in the mechanostat theory. Accordingly, new remodeling parameters can be derived from such data, including formation saturation levels (FSL), resorption velocity modulus (RVM), and remodeling thresholds (RmT). Our results revealed that the norm of the gradient of strain energy density ({nabla}SED) yielded the highest accuracy to quantify mechanoregulation data using micro-FE analysis with homogeneous material properties, while effective strain was the best predictor for micro-FE analysis with heterogeneous material properties.

However, it imposes demanding requirements on the properties of bioink. Gelatine methacryloyl has long been the major option but results in limited mechanical properties. The development of collagen-based bioink provides a wider stiffness adjustment range, native bioactivities, and versatility in biomedical engineering applications.

MethodCollagen solution was obtained via enzymolysis and ultrafiltration and then subjected to methacrylation. The photocrosslinkable bioink comprises collagen methacryloyl (ColMA), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), acetic acid, yellow food dye, and photoinitiator LAP. The 3D structures were fabricated utilising a commercial DLP printer with 405 nm visible light.

ResultsPurified type I collagen can be rapidly obtained via the developed process, and methacrylation is optimised for collagen with much less addition of methacrylic anhydride (MAA) and a high degree of substitution. The ColMA/PEGDA bioink is translucent and low viscosity and is suitable for DLP 3D printing. The printed scaffolds reached a compressive modulus over 100 kPa with 0.6 wt% collagen. Sharp-edged and fine structures ([~]500 m) were obtained by printing. The hydrogels show tunable mechanical properties by adjusting the concentration of the ColMA component. A series of models were fabricated to test the printability, including ear, cube with channels, and scaffolds, which display porous structures with pore sizes of 50 - 150 m.

Fibrosis is associated with the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which transdifferentiate into a myofibroblast like phenotype that is contractile, proliferative and profibrogenic. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, is elevated during HSC activation and promotes the expression of profibrotic mediator HIF target genes. HIF activation during HSC activation can by either due to localised decreases in oxygen levels, or through oxygen-independent mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here we describe a role for the deubiquitinase UCHL1 in regulating HIF levels and activity during HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Increased HIF1 expression correlated with induction of UCHL1 mRNA and protein with HSC activation. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of UCHL1 impaired HIF activity through reduction of HIF1 levels. UCHL1 specifically cleaves the degradative ubiquitin chains from HIF1 leading to increased HIF1 levels, even in sufficiently oxygenated cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies have shown that UCHL1 elevates HIF activity through specific cleavage of degradative ubiquitin chains, elevates levels of pro-fibrotic gene expression and increases proliferation rates. These results demonstrate how small molecule inhibitors of DUBs can modulate the activity of HIF transcription factors in liver disease. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF activity via modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway may represent a therapeutic opportunity with other HIF-related pathologies.

However, nearly all SRT technologies measure expression in two dimensional slices extracted from a three-dimensional tissue, thus losing information that is shared across multiple slices from the same tissue. Integrating SRT data across multiple slices can help recover this information and improve downstream expression analyses, but multi-slice alignment and integration remains a challenging task. Existing methods for integrating SRT data either do not use spatial information or assume that the morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an assumption that is often violated due to biological or technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a method for partial alignment and 3D reconstruction of multi-slice SRT datasets, allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or slice-specific cell types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq dataset. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multi-slice datasets from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of spatial gene expression across a wide range of biological applications.

PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq dataset. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multi-slice datasets from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of spatial gene expression across a wide range of biological applications.

Z.; Cavalheiro, E. A.; Domingues Bueno, D.",Joao Angelo Ferres Brogin,Universidade Estadual Paulista,2023-01-08,bioinformatics,"Epilepsy affects millions of people worldwide every year and remains an open subject for research. Current development on this field has focused on obtaining computational models to better understand its triggering mechanisms, attain realistic descriptions and study seizure suppression. Controllers have been successfully applied to mitigate epileptiform activity in dynamic models written in state-space notation, whose applicability is, however, restricted to signatures that are accurately described by them. Alternatively, autoregressive modeling (AR), a typical data-driven tool related to system identification (SI), can be directly applied to signals to generate more realistic models, and since it is inherently convertible into state-space, it can thus be used for the artificial reconstruction and attenuation of seizures as well. Considering this, the first objective of this work is to propose an SI approach using AR models to describe real epileptiform activity. The second objective is to provide a strategy for reconstructing and mitigating such activity artificially, considering non-hybrid and hybrid controllers - designed from ictal and interictal events, respectively. The results show that AR models of relatively low order represent epileptiform activities fairly well and both controllers are effective in attenuating the undesired activity while simultaneously driving the signal to an interictal stage. These findings may lead to customized models based on each signal, brain region or patient, from which it is possible to better define shape, frequency and duration of external stimuli that are necessary to attenuate seizures.

Author summaryEpilepsy is perhaps one of the most studied brain disorders and it is still not sufficiently well understood. The use of computational models is useful in this case since several simulations can be run using them, such that experience and insight about seizures can be gained without necessarily carrying out experiments. These models are usually designed with or without some knowledge about the brain region or phenomenon. Seizure attenuation approaches have been proposed for the first case, but they are limited to the type of seizure correctly described by the model. The present work proposes a similar procedure for the second one (where only the data are available and nothing else is assumed), which is regarded as more realistic due to its direct application on the signals and can lead to customized models for each activity, brain region or patient, defining important information such as the shape, frequency and duration of the external stimuli that must be applied to mitigate a seizure.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.522971,"Title: Epileptic seizure suppression: a computational approach for identification and control using real data; Authors: Ferres Brogin, J.

So far, most studies have used sugars (mostly glucose) or glycerol as the primary carbon source. In this study, we used ethylene glycol (EG) as the main carbon substrate. EG could be obtained from the degradation of plastic and cellulosic wastes. As a proof of concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to transform EG into L-tyrosine, a valuable aromatic amino acid. Under the best fermentation condition, the strain produced 2 g/L L-tyrosine from 10 g/L EG at approximately 50% of the theoretical yield, outperforming glucose (the most common sugar feedstock) in the same experimental conditions. To prove the concept that EG can be converted into different aromatic chemicals, E. coli was further engineered with a similar approach to synthesize other valuable aromatic chemicals, L-phenylalanine and p-coumaric acid. Finally, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were degraded using acid hydrolysis and the resulting monomer EG was transformed into L-tyrosine using the engineered E. coli, yielding a comparable titer to that obtained using commercial EG.
