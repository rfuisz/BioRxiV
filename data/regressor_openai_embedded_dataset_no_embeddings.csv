The most studied are 24-h (circadian) and shorter (ultradian) oscillations from them. A cosinor analysis often evaluates the presence and significance of circadian and ultradian rhythms.

Therefore, we developed CosinorOnline, a simple web-based application coded in PHP and JavaScript to evaluate the presence and significance of different oscillations. Users can set the period length on the applications page and insert their data. The results consist of a numerical evaluation and an adjustable plot. There is also a unique identifier to reload or immediately delete data analysis within one month. After this period, all data are automatically deleted from the app. We compared the functionality of CosinorOnline with Cosinor2 (R package) and Chronos-Fit (Windows app). The 24-h variability analysis was identical for all three applications. The evaluation of ultradian variability was the same for CosinorOnline and Cosinor2 and slightly different for Chronos-Fit.

The error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway depends on specialized DNA polymerases that incorporate nucleotides in front of base lesions, potentially inducing mutagenesis. Two error-free pathways can bypass the lesions: the template switching pathway, which uses the sister chromatid as a template, and the homologous recombination pathway (HR), which also can use the homologous chromosome as template. The balance between error-prone and error-free pathways controls the mutagenesis level. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely characterize factors that influence the pathway choice to better understand genetic stability at replication forks. In yeast, the complex formed by the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 promotes HR and template-switching at stalled replication forks. At DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), this complex promotes Rad51 filament formation and stability, notably by counteracting the Srs2 anti-recombinase. To explore the role of the Rad55-Rad57 complex in error-free pathways, we monitored the genetic interactions between Rad55-Rad57, the translesion polymerases Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta}, and Srs2 following UV radiation that induces mostly single-strand DNA gaps. We found that the Rad55-Rad57 complex was involved in three ways. First, it protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2, as it does at DSBs. Second, it promotes Rad51 filament stability independently of Srs2. Finally, we observed that UV-induced HR is almost abolished in Rad55-Rad57 deficient cells, and is partially restored upon Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta} depletion. Hence, we propose that the Rad55-Rad57 complex is essential to promote Rad51 filament stability on single-strand DNA gaps, notably to counteract the error-prone TLS polymerases and mutagenesis.

Pharmacological inhibition of TOP2A and KDM1A activities upregulates the expression of BAZ2A-repressed genes that are regulated by a class of inactive enhancers bound by BAZ2A whereas rRNA genes are not affected. Our findings showed a novel RNA-based mechanism of gene regulation in PCa. Further, the data indicate that RNA-mediated interactions between BAZ2A and TOP2A and KDM1A repress genes critical to PCa and may prove to be useful to stratify prostate cancer risk and treatment in patients.",396

Interpreting the functional impacts of VUS is challenging but profoundly important for clinical management and genetic counseling. To determine the consequences of population polymorphisms in key fertility genes, we functionally evaluated 11 missense variants in the genes ANKRD31, BRDT, DMC1, EXOI, FKBP6, MCM9, M1AP, MEI1, MSH4 and SEPT12 by generating genome-edited mouse models. Nine variants were classified as deleterious by most functional prediction algorithms, and two disrupted a protein-protein interaction in the yeast 2 hybrid assay.

To explore the disconnect between predictions and outcomes, we compared pathogenicity calls of missense variants made by ten widely-used algorithms to: 1) those present in ClinVar, and 2) those which have been evaluated in mice.

ResultsWe have developed a coarse-grained dynamical model of the Drosophila melanogaster nuclei at TAD resolution that explicitly accounts for four distinct epigenetic classes of TADs and LAD-NE interactions. The model is parameterized to reproduce the experimental Hi-C map of the wild type (WT) nuclei; it describes time evolution of the chromatin over the G1 phase of the interphase. Best agreement with the experiment is achieved when the simulations include an ensemble of nuclei, corresponding to the experimentally observed set of several possible mutual arrangements of chromosomal arms. The model is validated against multiple structural features of chromatin from several different experiments not used in model development, including those that describe changes in chromatin induced by lamin depletion. Predicted positioning of all LADs at the NE is highly dynamic - the same LAD can attach, detach and move far away from the NE multiple times during interphase. The probabilities of LADs to be in contact with the NE vary by an order of magnitude, despite all having the same affinity to the NE in the model. These probabilities are mostly determined by a highly variable local linear density of LADs along the genome which also has a strong effect on the predicted radial positioning of individual TADs. Higher probability of a TAD to be near NE is largely determined by a higher linear density of LADs surrounding this TAD. The distribution of LADs along the chromosome chains plays a notable role in maintaining a non-random average global structure of chromatin. Relatively high affinity of LADs to the NE in the WT nuclei substantially reduces sensitivity of the global radial chromatin distribution to variations in the strength of TAD-TAD interactions compared to the lamin depleted nuclei, where a 0.5 kT increase of cross-type TAD-TAD interactions doubles the chromatin density in the central nucleus region.

ConclusionsA dynamical model of the entire fruit fly genome makes multiple genome-wide predictions of biological interest. The distribution of LADs along the chromatin chains affects their probabilities to be in contact with the NE and radial positioning of highly mobile TADs, playing a notable role in creating a non-random average global structure of the chromatin. We conjecture that an important role of attractive LAD-NE interactions is to stabilize global chromatin structure against inevitable cell-to-cell variations in TAD-TAD interactions.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2022.01.28.478236,"Title: Strong interactions between highly-dynamic lamina-associated domains and the nuclear envelope stabilize the 3D architecture of Drosophila interphase chromatin; Authors: Tolokh, I.

Higher probability of a TAD to be near NE is largely determined by a higher linear density of LADs surrounding this TAD. The distribution of LADs along the chromosome chains plays a notable role in maintaining a non-random average global structure of chromatin. Relatively high affinity of LADs to the NE in the WT nuclei substantially reduces sensitivity of the global radial chromatin distribution to variations in the strength of TAD-TAD interactions compared to the lamin depleted nuclei, where a 0.5 kT increase of cross-type TAD-TAD interactions doubles the chromatin density in the central nucleus region.

ConclusionsA dynamical model of the entire fruit fly genome makes multiple genome-wide predictions of biological interest. The distribution of LADs along the chromatin chains affects their probabilities to be in contact with the NE and radial positioning of highly mobile TADs, playing a notable role in creating a non-random average global structure of the chromatin. We conjecture that an important role of attractive LAD-NE interactions is to stabilize global chromatin structure against inevitable cell-to-cell variations in TAD-TAD interactions.",638

We quantified mediolateral step modulation for both paretic and non-paretic steps by calculating partial correlations between mediolateral pelvis displacement at the start of each step and step width ({rho}SW), mediolateral foot placement relative to the pelvis ({rho}FP), and final mediolateral location of the pelvis ({rho}PD) at the end of the step. We also assessed several common clinical balance measures (Functional Gait Assessment [FGA], Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale [ABC], self-reported fear of falling and fall history). We performed Spearman correlations to relate each biomechanical metric of step modulation to FGA and ABC scores. We performed Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare each biomechanical metric between individuals with and without a fear of falling and a history of falls.

ResultsOnly {rho}FP for paretic steps was significantly related to all four clinical balance measures; higher paretic {rho}FP values tended to be observed in participants with higher FGA scores, with higher ABC scores, without a fear of falling and without a history of falls. However, the strength of each of these relationships was only weak to moderate.

SignificanceWhile the present results do not provide insight into causality, they justify future work investigating whether interventions designed to increase {rho}FP can improve clinical measures of post-stroke balance in parallel.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2022.04.26.489530,"Title: Relationships between mediolateral step modulation and clinical balance measures in people with chronic stroke; Authors: Howard, K.

Dean; Author Institution: Medical University of South Carolina; Category: bioengineering; Abstract: BackgroundMany people with chronic stroke (PwCS) exhibit walking balance deficits linked to increased fall risk and decreased balance confidence. One potential contributor to these balance deficits is a decreased ability to modulate mediolateral stepping behavior based on pelvis motion. This behavior, hereby termed mediolateral step modulation, is thought to be an important balance strategy but can be disrupted in PwCS.

A.; Chang, F.",Rikki M Garner,Harvard Medical School,2023-01-05,cell biology,"The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded, actively-driven environment whose biophysical characteristics modulate critical cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, phase separation, and stem-cell fate. Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40-nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelganger Simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak non-ergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, cytoskeletal effects, cell cycle stage and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not ""well-mixed"" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40-nm sizescale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population. These findings carry significant implications for the origins and regulation of biological noise at cellular and subcellular levels.

SignificanceBiophysical properties of the cytoplasm influence many cellular processes, from differentiation to cytoskeletal dynamics, yet little is known about how tightly cells control these properties. We developed a combined experimental and computational approach to analyze cytoplasmic heterogeneity through the lens of diffusion. We find that the apparent cytoplasmic viscosity varies tremendously - over 100-fold within any individual cell, and over 10-fold among individual cells when comparing averages of all particles measured for each cell. The variance was largely independent of temperature, the cytoskeleton, cell cycle stage, and localization, but was magnified under hyperosmotic shock. This suggests that cytoplasmic heterogeneity contributes substantially to biological variability within and between cells, and has significant implications for any cellular process that depends on diffusion.

Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are LROs of endothelial cells and also store VWF and P-selectin. In megakaryocytes, NBEAL2 links P-selectin on AGs to the SNARE protein SEC22B on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby preventing premature release of cargo from AG precursors. In endothelial cells, SEC22B drives VWF trafficking from ER to Golgi and promotes the formation of elongated WPBs, but it is unclear if this requires NBEAL2.

ObjectivesTo investigate a potential role for NBEAL2 in WPB biogenesis and VWF secretion using NBEAL2 deficient endothelial cells.

MethodsInteraction of SEC22B with NBEAL2 in endothelial cells was investigated by interactomic mass spectrometry and pull down analysis. Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs) were isolated from healthy controls and 3 unrelated GPS patients with mutations in NBEAL2.

ResultsWe show that SEC22B binds to NBEAL2 in ECs. GPS patient-derived ECFCs are deficient of NBEAL2, but reveal normal formation and maturation of WPBs and normal WPB cargo recruitment. Neither basal nor histamine-induced VWF secretion are altered in the absence of NBEAL2.

In this setting, a learning agent obtains a visual signal about its environment, and throughout trial-and-error over multiple attempts, the individual learns to perform a local CM with CA which emerges into a global CM with CA dynamics.

A broad form of genetic variation is the amplification or deletion of DNA ([&ge;]50 bp) referred to as copy number variation. In humans, copy number variation may be inconsequential, contribute to minor phenotypic differences, or cause conditions such as birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancers. To identify mechanisms that drive copy number variation, we monitored the experimental evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations grown under sulfate-limiting conditions. Cells with increased copy number of the gene SUL1, which encodes a primary sulfate transporter, exhibit a fitness advantage. Previously, we reported interstitial inverted triplications of SUL1 as the dominant rearrangement in a haploid population. Here, in a diploid population, we find instead that small linear fragments containing SUL1 form and are sustained over several generations. Many of the linear fragments are stabilized by de novo telomere addition within a telomere-like sequence near SUL1 (within the SNF5 gene). Using an assay that monitors telomerase action following an induced chromosome break, we show that this region acts as a hotspot of de novo telomere addition and that required sequences map to a region of <250 base pairs. Consistent with previous work showing that association of the telomere-binding protein Cdc13 with internal sequences stimulates telomerase recruitment, mutation of a four-nucleotide motif predicted to associate with Cdc13 abolishes de novo telomere addition. Our study suggests that internal telomere-like sequences that stimulate de novo telomere addition can contribute to adaptation by promoting genomic plasticity.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/16/2022.06.12.495855,"Title: Hotspot of de novo telomere addition stabilizes linear amplicons in yeast grown in sulfate-limiting conditions; Authors: Hoerr, R.

Cells with increased copy number of the gene SUL1, which encodes a primary sulfate transporter, exhibit a fitness advantage. Previously, we reported interstitial inverted triplications of SUL1 as the dominant rearrangement in a haploid population. Here, in a diploid population, we find instead that small linear fragments containing SUL1 form and are sustained over several generations. Many of the linear fragments are stabilized by de novo telomere addition within a telomere-like sequence near SUL1 (within the SNF5 gene). Using an assay that monitors telomerase action following an induced chromosome break, we show that this region acts as a hotspot of de novo telomere addition and that required sequences map to a region of <250 base pairs. Consistent with previous work showing that association of the telomere-binding protein Cdc13 with internal sequences stimulates telomerase recruitment, mutation of a four-nucleotide motif predicted to associate with Cdc13 abolishes de novo telomere addition. Our study suggests that internal telomere-like sequences that stimulate de novo telomere addition can contribute to adaptation by promoting genomic plasticity.",443

Here, we study an extreme case: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in UK Biobank. Previous studies found that shallow and deep MDD phenotypes have qualitatively distinct genetic architectures, but it remains unclear which are optimal for scientific study or clinical prediction. We propose a new framework to get the best of both worlds by integrating together information across hundreds of MDD-relevant phenotypes. First, we use phenotype imputation to increase sample size for the deepest available MDD phenotype, which dramatically improves GWAS power (increases #loci ~10 fold) and PRS accuracy (increases R2 ~2 fold).

Here, we study an extreme case: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in UK Biobank. Previous studies found that shallow and deep MDD phenotypes have qualitatively distinct genetic architectures, but it remains unclear which are optimal for scientific study or clinical prediction. We propose a new framework to get the best of both worlds by integrating together information across hundreds of MDD-relevant phenotypes. First, we use phenotype imputation to increase sample size for the deepest available MDD phenotype, which dramatically improves GWAS power (increases #loci ~10 fold) and PRS accuracy (increases R2 ~2 fold). Further, we show the genetic architecture of the imputed phenotype remains specific to MDD using genetic correlation, PRS prediction in external clinical cohorts, and a novel PRS-based pleiotropy metric. We also develop a complementary approach to improve specificity of GWAS on shallow MDD phenotypes by adjusting for phenome-wide PCs.

51,10.1101/2022.09.15.508150,Phosphorylation sites are evolutionary checkpoints against liquid-solid transition in protein condensates,"Ranganathan, S.; Dasmeh, P.; Furniss, S.; Shakhnovich, E.",Eugene Shakhnovich,Harvard University,2023-01-13,biophysics,"Assemblies of multivalent RNA-binding protein FUS can exist in the functional liquid-like state as well as less dynamic and potentially toxic amyloid- and hydrogel-like states. How could then cells form liquid-like condensates while avoiding their transformation to amyloids? Here we show how post-translational phosphorylation can provide a ""handle"" that prevents liquid-solid transition of intracellular condensates containing FUS. Using residue-specific coarse-grained simulations, for 85 different mammalian FUS sequences, we show how the number of phosphorylation sites and their spatial arrangement affect intracluster dynamics preventing conversion to amyloids. All atom simulations further confirm that phosphorylation can effectively reduce the {beta}-sheet propensity in amyloid-prone fragments of FUS. A detailed evolutionary analysis shows that mammalian FUS PLDs are enriched in amyloid-prone stretches compared to control neutrally evolved sequences suggesting that mammalian FUS proteins evolved to self-assemble. However, in stark contrast to proteins that do not phase-separate for their function, mammalian sequences have phosphosites in close proximity to these amyloid-prone regions. These results suggest that evolution uses amyloid-prone sequences in prion-like domains to enhance phase-separation of condensate proteins while enriching phosphorylation sites in close proximity to safe-guard against liquid-solid transitions.

Significance StatementIntrinsically disordered regions and prion-like domains are widely observed in proteins that get enriched in membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Mammalian Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) sequences are significantly enriched in amyloid-prone sequences suggesting that they have evolved to self-assemble. While the amyloid-prone stretches promote self-assembly of these proteins at lower threshold concentrations, these assemblies are vulnerable to aberrant liquid-solid phase transitions. Molecular simulations and bioinformatics analyses show that evolution overcomes this challenge by placing phosphosites specifically close to amyloid-prone stretches.

How could then cells form liquid-like condensates while avoiding their transformation to amyloids? Here we show how post-translational phosphorylation can provide a ""handle"" that prevents liquid-solid transition of intracellular condensates containing FUS. Using residue-specific coarse-grained simulations, for 85 different mammalian FUS sequences, we show how the number of phosphorylation sites and their spatial arrangement affect intracluster dynamics preventing conversion to amyloids. All atom simulations further confirm that phosphorylation can effectively reduce the {beta}-sheet propensity in amyloid-prone fragments of FUS. A detailed evolutionary analysis shows that mammalian FUS PLDs are enriched in amyloid-prone stretches compared to control neutrally evolved sequences suggesting that mammalian FUS proteins evolved to self-assemble. However, in stark contrast to proteins that do not phase-separate for their function, mammalian sequences have phosphosites in close proximity to these amyloid-prone regions. These results suggest that evolution uses amyloid-prone sequences in prion-like domains to enhance phase-separation of condensate proteins while enriching phosphorylation sites in close proximity to safe-guard against liquid-solid transitions.

Significance StatementIntrinsically disordered regions and prion-like domains are widely observed in proteins that get enriched in membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Mammalian Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) sequences are significantly enriched in amyloid-prone sequences suggesting that they have evolved to self-assemble. While the amyloid-prone stretches promote self-assembly of these proteins at lower threshold concentrations, these assemblies are vulnerable to aberrant liquid-solid phase transitions. Molecular simulations and bioinformatics analyses show that evolution overcomes this challenge by placing phosphosites specifically close to amyloid-prone stretches. Introduction of negatively charged residues at phosphosite locations results in fewer amyloid-prone contacts and thereby lower beta-sheet propensity. Phosphorylation can thus allow cells to utilize amyloid-prone stretches to promote biogenesis of MLOs while protecting against liquid-solid transitions.",520

Here, we have generated biologically replicated RNA-seq datasets from samples taken throughout the parasitic life of H. bakeri. We find extensive transcriptional sexual dimorphism throughout the fourth larval and adult stages of this parasite and identify alternative splicing, glycosylation, and ubiquitination as particularly important processes for establishing and/or maintaining sex-specific gene expression in this species. Further, we find sex-linked differences in transcription related to aging and oxidative and osmotic stress responses. Additionally, we observe a starvation-like signature among transcripts whose expression is consistently up-regulated in males, which may reflect a higher energy expenditure by male worms. We detect evidence of increased importance for anaerobic respiration among the adult worms, which coincides with the parasites migration into the physiologically hypoxic environment of the intestinal lumen. Further, we hypothesize that oxygen concentration may be an important driver of the worms encysting in the intestinal mucosa as larvae, which not only fully exposes the worms to their hosts immune system, but also shapes many of the interactions between the host and parasite. We find stage- and sex-specific variation in the expression of immunomodulatory genes and in anthelmintic targets.

The contribution of these three components of SAT was investigated in three different segments of the axon: the proximal portion, the central portion, and the distal portion of the axon. MAP1B protein was used as a model system to study SAT because there are published experimental data reporting MAP1B distribution along the axon length and average velocity of MAP1B transport in the axon.

We found that for the case when protein diffusivity and dynein velocity are very small, it is possible to obtain an analytical solution to model equations.

Here we report the development of a novel CD46-targeted alpha therapy based on YS5. We conjugated 212Pb, an in vivo generator of alpha-emitting 212Bi and 212Po, to YS5 through the chelator TCMC to create the radioimmunoconjugate, 212Pb-TCMC-YS5. We characterized 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 in vitro and established a safe dose in vivo. We next studied therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 using three prostate cancer small animal models: a subcutaneous mCRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model (subcu-CDX), an orthotopically grafted mCRPC CDX model (ortho-CDX), and a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft model (PDX). In all three models, a single dose of 20 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 was well tolerated and caused potent and sustained inhibition of established tumors, with significant increases of survival in treated animals. A lower dose (10 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5) was also studied on the PDX model, which also showed a significant effect on tumor growth inhibition and prolongation of animal survival.

Here we report the development of a novel CD46-targeted alpha therapy based on YS5. We conjugated 212Pb, an in vivo generator of alpha-emitting 212Bi and 212Po, to YS5 through the chelator TCMC to create the radioimmunoconjugate, 212Pb-TCMC-YS5. We characterized 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 in vitro and established a safe dose in vivo. We next studied therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 using three prostate cancer small animal models: a subcutaneous mCRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model (subcu-CDX), an orthotopically grafted mCRPC CDX model (ortho-CDX), and a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft model (PDX). In all three models, a single dose of 20 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 was well tolerated and caused potent and sustained inhibition of established tumors, with significant increases of survival in treated animals. A lower dose (10 Ci 212Pb-TCMC-YS5) was also studied on the PDX model, which also showed a significant effect on tumor growth inhibition and prolongation of animal survival. These results demonstrate that 212Pb-TCMC-YS5 has an excellent therapeutic window in preclinical models including PDXs, opening a direct path for clinical translation of this novel CD46-targeted alpha radioimmunotherapy for mCRPC treatment.

W.",Andrew Zheng,University of Toronto,2023-01-24,bioinformatics,"Taxonomic classification of reads obtained by metagenomic sequencing is often a first step for understanding a microbial community. While species level classification has become routine, correctly assigning sequencing reads to the strain or sub-species level has remained a challenging computational problem. We introduce Mora, a MetagenOmic read Re-Assignment algorithm capable of assigning short and long metagenomic reads with high precision, even at the strain level. Mora is able to accurately re-assign reads by first estimating abundances through an expectation-maximization algorithm and then utilizing abundance information to re-assign query reads. The key idea behind Mora is to maximize read re-assignment qualities while simultaneously minimizing the difference from estimated abundance levels, allowing Mora to avoid over assigning reads to the same genomes. On simulated data, this allows Mora to achieve F1 scores of > 74% when assigning reads generated from three distinct E. coli strains, more than double of the F1 scores achieved by Pathoscope2, Pufferfish, Clark, and Bowtie2. Furthermore, we show that the high penalty of over assigning reads to a common reference genome allows Mora to accurately identify the presence of low abundance strains and species.

While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion of kmt5, the gene encoding the sole methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 methylation, resulted in global derepression of transcription, especially in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Reversal of silencing in the absence of H4K20me3 not only affected genes but also a large number of novel, previously undetected, non-coding transcripts generated from regions of facultative heterochromatin on accessory chromosomes.

Such a complex series of immunizations unfortunately increases the cost and complexity of populations-scale vaccination and reduces overall compliance and vaccination rate. In a rapidly evolving pandemic affected by the spread of immune-escaping variants, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines capable of providing robust and durable immunity. In this work, we developed a single immunization SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine that could rapidly generate potent, broad, and durable humoral immunity. We leveraged injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels as a depot technology for the sustained delivery of a nanoparticle COVID antigen displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain (RBD NP), and potent adjuvants including CpG and 3M052.

S.; Saouaf, O. M.; Yan, J.; Bruun, T. U. J.; Baillet, J.; King, N. P.; Appel, E.; Corresponding Author: Eric Appel; Author Institution: Stanford University; Category: bioengineering; Abstract: Most vaccines require several immunizations to induce robust immunity, and indeed, most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines require an initial two-shot regimen followed by several boosters to maintain efficacy. Such a complex series of immunizations unfortunately increases the cost and complexity of populations-scale vaccination and reduces overall compliance and vaccination rate. In a rapidly evolving pandemic affected by the spread of immune-escaping variants, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines capable of providing robust and durable immunity. In this work, we developed a single immunization SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine that could rapidly generate potent, broad, and durable humoral immunity. We leveraged injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels as a depot technology for the sustained delivery of a nanoparticle COVID antigen displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain (RBD NP), and potent adjuvants including CpG and 3M052. Compared to a clinically relevant prime-boost regimen with soluble vaccines formulated with CpG/Alum or 3M052/Alum adjuvants, PNP hydrogel vaccines more rapidly generated higher, broader, and more durable antibody responses.

However, how this Ca2+ flux into the lumen of the TGN is achieved remains elusive, as the cytosol has a very low steady-state Ca2+ concentration. The TGN forms membrane contact sites (MCS) with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), whereby the close apposition of the two organelles allows the protein-mediated exchange of molecular species such as lipids.

During spindle checkpoint activation, checkpoint proteins bind the unattached kinetochore and send a diffusible signal to inhibit the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Previous work has shown that mitotic cells with depolymerized microtubules can escape prolonged spindle checkpoint activation in a process called mitotic slippage. During slippage, spindle checkpoint proteins bind unattached kinetochores, but the cells cannot maintain the checkpoint arrest. We asked if meiotic cells had as robust of a spindle checkpoint response as mitotic cells and whether they also undergo slippage after prolonged spindle checkpoint activity. We performed a direct comparison between mitotic and meiotic budding yeast cells that signal the spindle checkpoint due to a lack of either kinetochore-microtubule attachments or due to a loss of tension-bearing attachments. We find that the spindle checkpoint is not as robust in meiosis I or meiosis II compared to mitosis, overcoming a checkpoint arrest approximately 150 minutes earlier in meiosis. In addition, cells in meiosis I escape spindle checkpoint signaling using two mechanisms, silencing the checkpoint at the kinetochore and through slippage. We propose that meiotic cells undertake developmentally-regulated mechanisms to prevent persistent spindle checkpoint activity to ensure the production of gametes.

AUTHOR SUMMARYMitosis and meiosis are the two major types of cell divisions. Mitosis gives rise to genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis is a reductional division that gives rise to gametes. Cell cycle checkpoints are highly regulated surveillance mechanisms that prevent cell cycle progression when circumstances are unfavorable. The spindle checkpoint promotes faithful chromosome segregation to safeguard against aneuploidy, in which cells have too many or too few chromosomes. The spindle checkpoint is activated at the kinetochore and then diffuses to inhibit cell cycle progression. Although the checkpoint is active in both mitosis and meiosis, most studies involving checkpoint regulation have been performed in mitosis. By activating the spindle checkpoint in both mitosis and meiosis in budding yeast, we show that cells in meiosis elicit a less persistent checkpoint signal compared to cells in mitosis. Further, we show that cells use distinct mechanisms to escape the checkpoint in mitosis and meiosis I. While cells in mitosis and meiosis II undergo anaphase onset while retaining checkpoint proteins at the kinetochore, cells in meiosis I prematurely lose checkpoint protein localization at the kinetochore. If the mechanism to remove the checkpoint components from the kinetochore is disrupted, meiosis I cells can still escape checkpoint activity. Together, these results highlight that cell cycle checkpoints are differentially regulated during meiosis to avoid long delays and to allow gametogenesis.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522494,"Title: Meiotic Cells Escape Prolonged Spindle Checkpoint Activity Through Premature Silencing and Slippage; Authors: MacKenzie, A.; Vicory, V.; Lacefield, S.; Corresponding Author: Soni Lacefield; Author Institution: Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth; Category: cell biology; Abstract: To prevent chromosome mis-segregation, a surveillance mechanism known as the spindle checkpoint delays the cell cycle if kinetochores are not attached to spindle microtubules, allowing the cell additional time to correct improper attachments.

Perturbations affecting apicoplast function leads to parasite death. To maintain a functional apicoplast, the parasite must execute two important cellular processes: accurate division of this single copy organelle into daughter parasites during cell division and trafficking of nuclear encoded apicoplast proteins (NEAT). In this study we demonstrate that F-actin and an unconventional myosin motor, TgMyoF, are important for both processes. Live cell imaging demonstrates that during division the apicoplast is highly dynamic, exhibiting branched, U-shaped and linear morphologies that are dependent on TgMyoF and actin. These dynamics appear to control apicoplast association with the centrosome and positioning of the centrosome at the apicoplast tips. Loss of apicoplast dynamics correlated with reduced apicoplast-centrosome association and ultimately apicoplast inheritance defects. In addition, we uncovered the role of TgMyoF and actin in NEAT protein trafficking.

J.; Gelles, J.; Bell, S. P.",Stephen P. Bell,"MIT, Department of Biology",2023-01-02,molecular biology,"Eukaryotic DNA replication must occur exactly once per cell cycle to maintain cell ploidy. This outcome is ensured by temporally separating replicative helicase loading (G1 phase) and activation (S phase). In budding yeast, helicase loading is prevented outside of G1 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of three helicase-loading proteins: Cdc6, the Mcm2-7 helicase, and the origin recognition complex (ORC). CDK inhibition of Cdc6 and Mcm2-7 are well understood. Here we use single-molecule assays for multiple events during origin licensing to determine how CDK phosphorylation of ORC suppresses helicase loading. We find that phosphorylated ORC recruits a first Mcm2-7 to origins but prevents second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Phosphorylation of the Orc6, but not of the Orc2 subunit, increases the fraction of first Mcm2-7 recruitment events that are unsuccessful due to the rapid and simultaneous release of the helicase and its associated Cdt1 helicase-loading protein. Real-time monitoring of first Mcm2-7 ring closing reveals that either Orc2 or Orc6 phosphorylation prevents Mcm2-7 from stably encircling origin DNA. Consequently, we assessed formation of the MO complex, an intermediate that requires the closed-ring form of Mcm2-7. We found that ORC phosphorylation fully inhibits MO-complex formation and provide evidence that this event is required for stable closing of the first Mcm2-7. Our studies show that multiple steps of helicase loading are impacted by ORC phosphorylation and reveal that closing of the first Mcm2-7 ring is a two-step process started by Cdt1 release and completed by MO-complex formation.

Significance StatementEach time a eukaryotic cell divides (by mitosis) it must duplicate its chromosomal DNA exactly once to ensure that one full copy is passed to each resulting cell. Both under-replication or over-replication result in genome instability and disease or cell death. A key mechanism to prevent over-replication is the temporal separation of loading of the replicative DNA helicase at origins of replication and activation of these same helicases during the cell division cycle.

COVID-19 is a systemic disease that affects tissues and organs, including the lung and liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the most common liver cancer, and cancer patients are particularly at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between HCC and COVID-19 has been reported in previous studies, but ICC has been rare.

Two-colour single molecule localization microscopy of TOCA-1 and Ena supports their nanoscale association. TOCA-1 clusters coalesce at advancing lamellipodia and filopodia and operate synergistically with Ena to promote filopodial protrusion dependent on a functional SH3 domain. In analogous yet distinct ways to lamellipodin and IRSp53, we propose that transient TOCA-1 clusters recruit and promote Ena activity to orchestrate filopodial protrusion.",390

Here, we introduce a MuLan-Methyl, a deep learning framework for predicting DNA methylation sites, which is based on multiple (five) popular transformer-based language models.

It was recently demonstrated that Zn-induced B-repeat assembly leads to formation of functional amyloid fibrils, which offer strength and stability to the biofilm. Rigorous biophysical studies of Aap B-repeats from S. epidermidis strain RP62A revealed Zn-induced assembly into a stable, reversible dimer and tetramer, prior to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Genetic manipulation is not tractable for many S. epidermidis strains, including RP62A; instead, many genetic studies have used strain 1457. Therefore, to better connect findings from biophysical and structural studies of B-repeats to in vivo studies, the B-repeat superdomain from strain 1457 was examined. Differences between the B-repeats from strain RP62A and 1457 include the number of B-repeats, which has been shown to play a critical role in assembly into amyloid fibrils, as well as the distribution of consensus and variant B-repeat subtypes, which differ in assembly competency and thermal stability. Detailed investigation of the Zn-induced assembly of the full B-repeat supderdomain from strain 1457 was conducted using analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas the previous construct from RP62A (Brpt5.5) formed a stable tetramer prior to aggregation, Brpt6.5 from 1457 forms extremely large stable species on the order of 28- and 32-mers, prior to aggregation into similar amyloid fibrils.

D.",Clemence Fraslin,The Roslin Institute,2023-01-04,genetics,"BackgroundFlavobacterium columnare is the pathogen agent of columnaris disease, a major emerging disease affecting rainbow trout aquaculture. Selective breeding using genomic selection has potential to achieve cumulative improvement of host resistance. However, genomic selection is expensive partly due to the cost of genotyping high numbers of animals using high-density SNP arrays. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of genomic selection for resistance to F. columnare using in silico low-density (LD) panels combined with imputation. After a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 2,874 challenged fish and 469 fish from the parental generation (n=81 parents) were genotyped with 27,907 SNPs. The efficiency of genomic prediction using LD-panels was assessed for panels of 10 different densities, created in silico using two sampling methods, random and equally spaced. All LD-panels were also imputed to the full 28K HD-panel using the parental generation as the reference population, and genomic predictions were reevaluated. The potential of prioritizing SNPs showing association with resistance to F. columnare was also tested for the six lower densities.

ResultsSimilar results were obtained with random and equally spaced sampling of SNPs for accuracy of both imputation and genomic predictions. Using LD-panels of at least 3,000 makers or lower density panels (as low as 300 markers) combined with imputation resulted in comparable accuracy to the 28K HD-panel and 11% higher accuracy than pedigree-based predictions.

Here, we use a supported lipid bilayer platform in tandem with total internal reflection microscopy to observe the 2-dimensional movement of DNA and nucleosomes at the single-molecule resolution. This dimensional reduction from 3-dimensional studies allows us to observe the initial condensation events and dissolution of these early condensates in the presence of physiological condensing agents.

In addition, we did not observe condensate dissolution even at the highest concentrations of HP1 and Ki-67 tested. We also introduce a two-color imaging scheme where nucleosomes of high density labeled in one color is used to demarcate condensate boundaries and identical nucleosomes of another color at low density can be tracked relative to the boundaries after Ki-67 mediated condensation.

Cytoskeletal active gels display rich emergent dynamics, including extensile chaotic flows, locally contractile asters, and bulk contraction. However, it is unclear which protein-scale interactions, if any, set the contractile or extensile nature of the active gel, or how to control the transition from one phase to another in a simple active system. Here, we explore the microscopic origin of the extensile-to-contractile transition in a reconstituted active material composed of stabilized microtubules, depletant, ATP, and clusters of kinesin-1 motors. We show that microscopic interactions between highly processive motor clusters and microtubules can trigger the end-accumulation of motor proteins, which in turn drives polarity sorting and aster formation. Combining experiments and simple scaling arguments, we demonstrate that the extensile-to-contractile transition is akin to a self-assembly process where nematic and polar aligning interactions compete. We identify a single control parameter given by the ratio of the different component concentrations that dictates the material-scale organization into either a contractile aster or an extensile bundle.

However, the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) has been implicated in diabetic pathogenesis and the use of AGEs in tissues as long-term glycemic markers may be of value in the clinical setting. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how different tissue constituents respond to dietary monosaccharides. In this study, we studied the in vitro rate of fluorescent AGEs (fAGEs) formation with multiphoton microscopy in different porcine tissues (aorta, cornea, kidney, dermis, and tendon). These tissues were treated with D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose, three primary monosaccharides found in human diets. We found that the use of D-fructose resulted in the highest glycation rate, followed by D-galactose and then D-glucose.

However, the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) has been implicated in diabetic pathogenesis and the use of AGEs in tissues as long-term glycemic markers may be of value in the clinical setting. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how different tissue constituents respond to dietary monosaccharides. In this study, we studied the in vitro rate of fluorescent AGEs (fAGEs) formation with multiphoton microscopy in different porcine tissues (aorta, cornea, kidney, dermis, and tendon). These tissues were treated with D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose, three primary monosaccharides found in human diets. We found that the use of D-fructose resulted in the highest glycation rate, followed by D-galactose and then D-glucose. Moreover, compared to non-collagen tissue constituents such as elastic fibers and cells, the rate of tissue glycation was consistently higher in collagen, suggesting that collagen is a more sensitive target for fAGE formation.

Chakraborty,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2023-01-04,biophysics,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform several important functions in cells including cis-regulation of transcription. Barring a few specific cases, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs remain poorly understood. Transcriptional proteins can form condensates via phase separation at protein-binding loci (BL) on the genome (e.g., enhancers and promoters). lncRNA-coding genes are present at loci in close genomic proximity of these BL and these RNAs can interact with transcriptional proteins via attractive heterotypic interactions mediated by their net charge. Motivated by these observations, we propose that lncRNAs can dynamically regulate transcription in cis via charge-based heterotypic interactions with transcriptional proteins in condensates. To study the consequences of this mechanism, we developed and studied a dynamical phase-field model. We find that proximal lncRNAs can promote condensate formation at the BL. Vicinally localized lncRNA can migrate to the BL to attract more protein because of favorable interaction free energies. However, increasing the distance beyond a threshold leads to a sharp decrease in protein recruitment to the BL. This finding could potentially explain why genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes and protein-coding genes are conserved across metazoans. Finally, our model predicts that lncRNA transcription can fine-tune transcription from neighboring condensate-controlled genes, repressing transcription from highly expressed genes and enhancing transcription of genes expressed at a low level. This non-equilibrium effect can reconcile conflicting reports that lncRNAs can enhance or repress transcription from proximal genes.

We show that the conformational free energy landscape of the caspase monomer is conserved in the monomeric and dimeric subfamilies. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence or absence of urea, coupled with limited trypsin proteolysis and mass spectrometry, show that the small subunit is unstable in the protomer and unfolds prior to the large subunit. In addition, the unfolding of helix 2 in the large subunit results in disruption of a conserved allosteric site. Because the small subunit forms the interface for dimerization, our results highlight an important driving force for the evolution of the dimeric caspase subfamily through stabilizing the small subunit.",361

Viral DNA polymerase-inhibiting nucleoside analogs (such as acyclovir) are standard treatment agents against HSV infections but are limited by severe drug resistance issues. Thus, new antiviral agents with novel targets are urgently needed. Earlier, we investigated the anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial bioactivities of Garcinia sp. Here, we report that non-cytotoxic concentrations (< 500 nM) of Gaudichaudione H (GH, isolated from Garcinia oligantha Merr.) potently inhibits HSV-1 replication in vitro without affecting viral entry or attachment. GH inhibits the expression of the viral proteins ICP0, ICP4, and ICP27 without affecting their mRNA levels. In Vero cells, GH enhanced STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation, which occurs downstream to interferon (IFN)-{gamma} activation during viral infections. However, pharmacological/genetic inhibition of IFN-{gamma} failed to suppress the GH-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 replication, indicating that GH exerts antiviral effects independent of IFN. Further mechanistic studies suggest that GH inhibits HSV-1 replication, at least partially by inhibiting cellular NF-{kappa}B activation. Moreover, GH prolonged the survival rate of KOS-infected mice by 25% (n = 5). In conclusion, GH treatment inhibits HSV-1 replication both in vitro and in vivo; therefore, it can be developed as an antiviral.

In Vero cells, GH enhanced STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation, which occurs downstream to interferon (IFN)-{gamma} activation during viral infections. However, pharmacological/genetic inhibition of IFN-{gamma} failed to suppress the GH-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 replication, indicating that GH exerts antiviral effects independent of IFN. Further mechanistic studies suggest that GH inhibits HSV-1 replication, at least partially by inhibiting cellular NF-{kappa}B activation. Moreover, GH prolonged the survival rate of KOS-infected mice by 25% (n = 5). In conclusion, GH treatment inhibits HSV-1 replication both in vitro and in vivo; therefore, it can be developed as an antiviral.

ImportanceVery few therapeutic drug options are available to treat herpes simplex virus-1/2 which cause myriad debilitating diseases. We screened eight Garcinia compounds and found Gaudichaudione H was the most effective compound at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Further mechanism study illustrates that GH inhibits HSV-1 replication, at least partially by inhibiting cellular NF-{kappa}B activation. Natural compound is a promising resource of new antiviral agents with different targets that has ability to treat resistant viral strains.",513

While we have employed this system extensively for our ongoing genetic studies, we have encountered a couple limitations with the system, mainly its narrow host range and the requirement for selection on a toxic substrate. Here, we report the development of a new negative selection system that addresses both limitations, while still retaining the utility of the previous 4-CP-based markerless mutagenesis system. We placed a variety of toxin-encoding genes under the control of the xylose-inducible Xyl-S expression cassette and found the Fst-sm and ParE toxins to be suitable candidates for inducible negative selection. We combined the inducible toxins with an antibiotic resistance gene to create several different counterselection cassettes. The most broadly useful of these contained a wild-type fst-sm open reading frame transcriptionally fused to a point mutant form of the Xyl-S expression system, which we subsequently named as IFDC4. IFDC4 was shown to exhibit exceptionally low background resistance, with 3 - 4 log reductions in cell number observed when plating on xylose-supplemented media.
