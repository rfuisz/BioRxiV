Impaired renal gluconeogenesis has been recently identified as a hallmark of CKD. The role of gluconeogenesis in renal fibrosis is currently unknown. Through RNA sequencing and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) sequencing analysis, we found that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), a critical enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is negatively regulated by the methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in fibrotic kidneys, which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR, CUT&Tag and Western blotting analysis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys and renal cells. We further showed that pharmaceutical inhibition or conditional knockout of EZH2 increased PCK1 expression and attenuated renal fibrosis in two other mouse models. Moreover, the concentration of lactate, a glucogenic metabolic intermediate, was increased in mouse fibrotic kidneys, which was reduced by EZH2 inhibition. We further showed that glucose production was impaired in folic acid induced nephrotic mice and restored by EZH2 inhibition as assessed by pyruvate tolerance test. Importantly, the direct anti-gluconeogenesis effect of EZH2 on renal proximal epithelial cells was shown in human HK2 cells by analysis of gluconeogenic gene expression and production of glucose or lactate.

Here we report the role of muropeptides derived from bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) in promoting mitochondrial functions in mammalian models. We found that muropeptides directly bind to ATP synthase, which stabilizes the complex and promotes its activity. The benefit is seen in increased oxidative respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as decreased oxidative stress in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Strikingly, we also found that muropeptide treatment can recover mitochondrial structure and functions, as well as inhibit several pathological phenotypes of mutant fibroblast cells derived from mitochondrial disease patients. In mice, we show muropeptides accumulate in mitochondria of IECs and promote small intestinal homeostasis and nutrient absorption by modulating energy metabolism. This study identifies ATP synthase as a muropeptide receptor and the corresponding physiological function in mammals, and points to a potential treatment for human mitochondrial dysfunction diseases.

While several tools for estimating mutation rates are available, they sometimes lack accuracy or versatility under non-standard conditions. In this work we developed extensions to the Luria- Delbruck protocol to account for phenotypic lag and cellular death with either perfect or partial plating. Hence, our novel MLE MUtation Rate calculator, or mlemur, is the first tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface allowing the researchers to model their data with consideration for partial plating, differential growth of mutants and non-mutants, phenotypic lag, cellular death, variability of the final number of cells, post-exponential-phase mutations, and the size of inoculum. Additionally, mlemur allows the users to incorporate most of these special conditions at the same time to obtain highly accurate estimates of mutation rates and p values, confidence intervals for an arbitrary function of data (such as fold) and perform power analysis and sample size determination for the likelihood ratio test. We assess the accuracy of point and interval estimates produced by mlemur against historical and simulated fluctuation experiments.

In this study, we present a synthetic protein termed GLamouR that binds and reports gadolinium in an intensiometric manner. We then explore the extraction of gadolinium from GBCA-spiked artificial urine samples and investigate if the low picomolar concentrations reported in gadolinium-contaminated water sources pose a barrier for bioremediation. Based on promising results, we anticipate GLamouR can be used for detecting and mining REEs beyond gadolinium as well and hope to expand the biological toolbox for such applications.",259

Initial in vitro assessment with Saos-2 cells showed favourable cell proliferation at pore sizes of 300 and 600 m.

At twelve weeks, both scaffolds were filled with a mixture of adipocyte-rich marrow, micro-capillaries, and mineralized bone tissue. X-ray microcomputed tomography showed a higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and percentage of bone-implant contact (BIC) in the implants with 300 m pores than in the functionally-graded specimens, indicating that these smaller pore sizes may be favourable for osseointegration in leporine bone.

A.; Raphael, B.",Benjamin Raphael,Princeton University,2023-01-06,bioinformatics,"Tumors consist of subpopulations of cells that harbor distinct collections of somatic mutations. These mutations range in scale from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to large-scale copy-number aberrations (CNAs). While many approaches infer tumor phylogenies using SNVs as phylogenetic markers, CNAs that overlap SNVs may lead to erroneous phylogenetic inference. Specifically, an SNV may be lost in a cell due to a deletion of the genomic segment containing the SNV. Unfortunately, no current single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) technology produces accurate measurements of both SNVs and CNAs. For instance, recent targeted scDNA-seq technologies, such as Mission Bio Tapestri, measure SNVs with high fidelity in individual cells, but yield much less reliable measurements of CNAs. We introduce a new evolutionary model, the constrained k-Dollo model, that uses SNVs as phylogenetic markers and partial information about CNAs in the form of clustering of cells with similar copy-number profiles. This copy-number clustering constrains where loss of SNVs can occur in the phylogeny. We develop ConDoR (Constrained Dollo Reconstruction), an algorithm to infer tumor phylogenies from targeted scDNA-seq data using the constrained k-Dollo model. We show that ConDoR outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We use ConDoR to analyze a new multi-region targeted scDNA-seq dataset of 2153 cells from a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor and produce a more plausible phylogeny compared to existing methods that conforms to histological results for the tumor from a previous study. We also analyze a metastatic colorectal cancer dataset, deriving a more parsimonious phylogeny than previously published analyses and with a simpler monoclonal origin of metastasis compared to the original study.

Due to their complex life cycle involving both vertebrate and insect hosts, and > 1 billion years of evolutionarily distance, the cell biology of these trypanosomatid parasites exhibits pronounced differences to animal cells. For example, the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatids is highly divergent when compared to the other eukaryotes. To understand how actin dynamics are regulated in trypanosomatid parasites, we focused on a central actin-binding protein profilin. Co-crystal structure of Leishmania major actin in complex with L. major profilin revealed that, although the overall folds of actin and profilin are conserved in eukaryotes, Leishmania profilin contains a unique -helical insertion, which interacts with the target binding cleft of actin monomer. This insertion is conserved across the Trypanosomatidae family, and is strikingly similar to the structure of WH2 domain, a small actin-binding motif found in many other cytoskeletal regulators. We demonstrate that the WH2-like motif contributes to actin monomer-binding and enhances the actin nucleotide exchange activity of Leishmania profilin. Surprisingly, unlike other profilins characterized so far, Leishmania profilin inhibited formin-catalyzed actin filament assembly in a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of the WH2-like motif. By generating profilin knockout and knockin Leishmania mexicana strains, we show that profilin is important for efficient endocytic sorting in parasites, and that the ability to bind actin monomers and proline-rich proteins, as well as the presence of a functional WH2-like motif, are important for the in vivo function of Leishmania profilin. Collectively, this study uncovers the molecular principles by which actin dynamics are regulated by profilin in trypanosomatids. Moreover, the unusual actin-binding mechanism of profilin identified here could be applied for designing inhibitors against pathogenic trypanosomatid parasites.

AUTHOR SUMMARYLeishmania and Trypanosoma parasites are a major health problem as they cause various diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat the diseases caused by these trypanosomatid parasites. Similar to all other eukaryotes, trypanosomatid parasites have an actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the viability of parasites. Interestingly, both actin and actin-regulatory machineries of these parasites are highly divergent from the ones of animals, making them possible drug targets to treat diseases caused by these parasites. To uncover how the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatid parasites is regulated, we focused on a central actin-binding protein, profilin. Importantly, our experiments revealed that trypanosomatid profilins interact with actin through a different structural mechanism as compared to animal profilins, and have specific effects on the assembly of actin filaments. Our genetic studies demonstrate that these specific features of trypanosomatid profilin are also critical for the proper function on this protein in parasites. Our study provides new insight into the cell biology of trypanosomatid parasites.
