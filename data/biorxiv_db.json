The most studied are 24-h (circadian) and shorter (ultradian) oscillations from them. A cosinor analysis often evaluates the presence and significance of circadian and ultradian rhythms. Skilled researchers can use MATLAB, R, Python, or other programming languages, while those less experienced often use outdated applications that require a specific operating system version or outdated add-ons. Therefore, we developed CosinorOnline, a simple web-based application coded in PHP and JavaScript to evaluate the presence and significance of different oscillations. Users can set the period length on the applications page and insert their data. The results consist of a numerical evaluation and an adjustable plot. There is also a unique identifier to reload or immediately delete data analysis within one month. After this period, all data are automatically deleted from the app. We compared the functionality of CosinorOnline with Cosinor2 (R package) and Chronos-Fit (Windows app). The 24-h variability analysis was identical for all three applications. The evaluation of ultradian variability was the same for CosinorOnline and Cosinor2 and slightly different for Chronos-Fit. CosinorOnline and Chronos-Fit result in acrophase in units of time (decimal form), while Cosinor2 is in radians. In conclusion, CosinorOnline is a simple, easy-to-use web application to inspect time data that provides reliable results without additional installation and runs in modern web browsers. The application does not track users and aims to help users quickly decide whether their data is suitable for more profound analysis using cosinor analysis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/805960"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.01.29.926022", "title": "CopyMix: Mixture Model Based Single-Cell Clustering and Copy Number Profiling using Variational Inference", "authors": "Safinianaini, N.; P.

Accordingly, computational methods have emerged for single-cell copy number profiling and clustering; however, these two tasks have, up to now, been handled sequentially and included various ad-hoc preprocessing steps; hence, a procedure vulnerable to introducing clustering artifacts. We propose CopyMix, a mixture-model-based method using Variational Inference, to simultaneously cluster cells and infer a single copy number profile for each cluster, revealing the underlying copy number variation pattern for each cluster. In addition, an extension of CopyMix, SNV-CopyMix, allows the incorporation of single-nucleotide variation (SNV) data into the proposed model to further inform cluster inference. We evaluate CopyMix using simulated data and published biological data from ovarian cancer. The results reveal high clustering performance and low errors in copy number profiling.

However, self-assembled or older systems typically have to fend for their own or adapt their measurements to circumvent drift effects. In this manuscript, we propose a cost-efficient z-drift detection- and correction system that, due to its modular design, can be attached to any fluorescence microscope with an actuated stage or objective, be it in a custom or commercial setup. The reason for this wide applicability is specific to the design, which has a straightforward alignment procedure and allows sharing optics with the fluorescent emission path. Our system employs an infrared (IR) laser that is passed through a double-hole mask to achieve two parallel beams which are made to reflect on the coverslip and subsequently detected on an industrial sCMOS camera. The relative position of these beams is then uniquely linked to the z-position of a microscope-mounted sample. The system was benchmarked by introducing temperature perturbations, where it was shown to achieve a stable focus, and by scanning different positions while simulating a perturbation in the z-position of the stage, where we show that a lost focus can be recovered within seconds.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2020.09.22.308197"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.10.06.328799", "title": "Detection of a reservoir of bedaquiline / clofazimine resistance associated variants in Mycobacterium tuberculosis predating the antibiotic era", "authors": "van Dorp, L.; Nimmo, C.; Torres Ortiz, A.; Pang, J.; Acman, M.; Tan, C.

Our understanding of how Stag proteins contribute to cell identity have largely been focused on its roles in chromosome topology as part of the cohesin complex and the impact on protein-coding gene expression. Furthermore, several Stag paralogs exist in mammalian cells with non-reciprocal chromosome structure and cohesion functions. Why cells have so many Stag proteins and what specific functions each Stag protein performs to support a given cell state are poorly understood. Here we reveal that Stag1 is the dominant paralog in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and is required for pluripotency. Through the discovery of diverse, naturally occurring Stag1 isoforms in mESCs, we shed new light not only on the unique ends of Stag1 but also the critical role that their levels play in stem cell identity. Furthermore, we revel a new role for Stag1, and specifically its unique N-terminal end, in regulating nucleolar integrity and safeguarding mESCs from totipotency. Stag1 is localised to repressive perinucleolar regions, bound at repeats and interacts with Nucleolin and TRIM28. Loss of the Stag1 N-terminus, leads to decreased LINE-1 and rRNA expression and disruption of nucleolar structure and function which consequently leads to activation of the two-cell-like (2C-LC)-specific transcription factor DUX and conversion of pluripotent mESCs to totipotent 2C-LCs.

So far, a number of deconvolution methods have emerged for estimating cell composition using reference signatures, either based on gene expression or on DNA methylation from purified cells. These two deconvolution approaches could be complementary to each other, leading to even more performant signatures, in cases where both data types are available. However, the potential relationship between signatures based on gene expression and those based on DNA methylation remains underexplored.\n\nHere we present five new deconvolution signature matrices, based RNAseq data or on DNA methylation, which can estimate the proportion of immune cells and cancer cells in a tumour sample. We test these signature matrices on available datasets for in-silico and in-vitro mixtures, peripheral blood, cancer samples from TCGA, and a single-cell melanoma dataset.

The error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway depends on specialized DNA polymerases that incorporate nucleotides in front of base lesions, potentially inducing mutagenesis. Two error-free pathways can bypass the lesions: the template switching pathway, which uses the sister chromatid as a template, and the homologous recombination pathway (HR), which also can use the homologous chromosome as template. The balance between error-prone and error-free pathways controls the mutagenesis level. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely characterize factors that influence the pathway choice to better understand genetic stability at replication forks. In yeast, the complex formed by the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 promotes HR and template-switching at stalled replication forks. At DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), this complex promotes Rad51 filament formation and stability, notably by counteracting the Srs2 anti-recombinase. To explore the role of the Rad55-Rad57 complex in error-free pathways, we monitored the genetic interactions between Rad55-Rad57, the translesion polymerases Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta}, and Srs2 following UV radiation that induces mostly single-strand DNA gaps. We found that the Rad55-Rad57 complex was involved in three ways. First, it protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2, as it does at DSBs. Second, it promotes Rad51 filament stability independently of Srs2. Finally, we observed that UV-induced HR is almost abolished in Rad55-Rad57 deficient cells, and is partially restored upon Pol{zeta} or Pol{eta} depletion. Hence, we propose that the Rad55-Rad57 complex is essential to promote Rad51 filament stability on single-strand DNA gaps, notably to counteract the error-prone TLS polymerases and mutagenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryProcessive and accurate DNA polymerases replicate genomic DNA during the S phase of each cell cycle. DNA base lesions on template DNA block these polymerases and result in an accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps behind moving replication forks. These gaps are filled-in by error-prone and error-free pathways. In this work, we show that the complex made by the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 is essential for the error-free homologous recombination gap-filling pathway when DNA replication is stalled by UV-induced DNA lesions, but not for DNA double strand break repair. Interestingly, we found that homologous recombination is efficiently outcompeted by error-prone translesion DNA polymerases in Rad55-Rad57-deficient cells. We propose that the Rad55-Rad57 complex is essential for Rad51 filament stability at UV-induced DNA gaps to promote efficient error-free homologous recombination. Furthermore, our study in yeast predicts that inhibitors of error-prone DNA polymerases might selectively target cancer cells in which RAD51 paralogs are mutated.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2021.05.27.446004"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.06.16.448102", "title": "Defining protein variant functions using high-complexity mutagenesis libraries and enhanced mutant detection software ASMv1.0", "authors": "Yang, X.; Hong, A.

In prostate cancer (PCa), however, BAZ2A function goes beyond this role since it can also repress other genes that are frequently silenced in metastatic disease. However, the mechanisms of BAZ2A-mediated repression in PCa remain elusive. Here we show that BAZ2A represses genes implicated in PCa through its RNA-binding TAM domain using mechanisms differing from rRNA gene silencing. While TAM domain mediates BAZ2A recruitment to rRNA genes, in PCa cells this is not required for BAZ2A association with target genes. Instead, BAZ2A-TAM domain in association with RNA mediates the interaction with topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and histone demethylase KDM1A, whose expression positively correlates with BAZ2A levels in both localized and aggressive PCa. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP2A and KDM1A activities upregulates the expression of BAZ2A-repressed genes that are regulated by a class of inactive enhancers bound by BAZ2A whereas rRNA genes are not affected. Our findings showed a novel RNA-based mechanism of gene regulation in PCa.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is becoming an increasingly important tool for genetic diagnosis of diseases including idiopathic infertility, however, most rare or minor alleles revealed by HTS are variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Interpreting the functional impacts of VUS is challenging but profoundly important for clinical management and genetic counseling. To determine the consequences of population polymorphisms in key fertility genes, we functionally evaluated 11 missense variants in the genes ANKRD31, BRDT, DMC1, EXOI, FKBP6, MCM9, M1AP, MEI1, MSH4 and SEPT12 by generating genome-edited mouse models. Nine variants were classified as deleterious by most functional prediction algorithms, and two disrupted a protein-protein interaction in the yeast 2 hybrid assay. Even though these genes are known to be essential for normal meiosis or spermiogenesis in mice, only one of the tested human variants (rs1460351219, encoding p.R581H in MCM9), which was observed in a male infertility patient, compromised fertility or gametogenesis in the mouse models. To explore the disconnect between predictions and outcomes, we compared pathogenicity calls of missense variants made by ten widely-used algorithms to: 1) those present in ClinVar, and 2) those which have been evaluated in mice. We found that all the algorithms performed poorly in terms of predicting the effects of human missense variants that have been modeled in mice. These studies emphasize caution in the genetic diagnoses of infertile patients based primarily on pathogenicity prediction algorithms, and emphasize the need for alternative and efficient in vitro or vivo functional validation models for more effective and accurate VUS delineation to either pathogenic or benign categories.\n\nSignificanceAlthough infertility is a substantial medical problem that affects up to 15% of couples, the potential genetic causes of idiopathic infertility have been difficult to decipher. This problem is complicated by the large number of genes that can cause infertility when perturbed, coupled with the large number of VUS that are present in the genomes of affected patients. Here, we present and analyze mouse modeling data of missense variants that are classified as deleterious by commonly-used pathogenicity prediction algorithms but which caused no detectible phenotype when introduced into mice by genome editing. We find that augmenting pathogenicity predictions with preliminary screens for biochemical defects substantially enhanced the proportion of prioritized variants that caused phenotypes in mice. The results emphasize that, in the absence of substantial improvements of in silico prediction tools or other compelling pre-existing evidence, in vivo analysis is crucial for confident attribution of infertility alleles.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2021.10.12.464112"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.11.02.466997", "title": "Novel insights into the cold resistance of Hevea brasiliensis through coexpression networks", "authors": "Silva, C.

Together with traditional differential expression approaches, a RNA-seq gene co-expression network (GCN) was established with 27,220 genes that were grouped into 205 gene clusters. Through the GCN, we could relate the predominance of rubber tree molecular responses on cold stress to 31 clusters, which were divided in three GCN modules: a down-regulated group with 16 clusters and two up-regulated groups with twelve and three clusters, respectively. The hub genes of the cold-responsive modules were identified and analyzed as well. Considering the three modules and hub genes identified, the general Hevea response to short term cold exposure involves a complex regulation of Jasmonic Acid (JA) stress response and programmed cell death (PCD), up-regulation of Ethylene responsive genes and relaxation on the inhibition of florigen genes. As a result of the GCN strategy applied in this study, we could not only access single DEGs related to Hevea cold responses, but also provide insights into a deeper cascade of associated mechanisms involved in the response to cold stress in young rubber trees.

Furthermore, the combined biomarkers used to maintain high conservation may not be cost effective and could cause several experimental errors in many clinical settings. Given the limitations of recent developed technology, 16S rRNA is too conserved to distinguish closely related species, and mosaic plasmids are not effective as well because of their uneven distribution across prokaryotic taxa.\n\nResultsHere, we provide a computational strategy, Shine, that allows extraction of specific, sensitive and well-conserved biomarkers from massive microbial genomic datasets.

Nevertheless, HKG may vary gene expression profile according to different variables introducing systematic errors into experimental results. Sex bias can indeed affect expression display, however, up to date, sex has not been typically considered as a biological variable.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we evaluate the expression profiles of six classical housekeeping genes (four metabolic: GAPDH, HPRT, PPIA, and UBC, and two ribosomal: 18S and RPL19) to determine expression stability in adipose tissues (AT) of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and check sex bias and their overall suitability as internal controls. We also assess the expression stability of all genes included in distinct whole-transcriptome microarrays available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify sex-unbiased housekeeping genes (suHKG) suitable for use as internal controls. We perform a novel computational strategy based on meta-analysis techniques to identify any sexual dimorphisms in mRNA expression stability in AT and to properly validate potential candidates.\n\nResultsJust above half of the considered studies informed properly about the sex of the human samples, however, not enough female mouse samples were found to be included in this analysis. We found differences in the HKG expression stability in humans between female and male samples, with females presenting greater instability. We propose a suHKG signature including experimentally validated classical HKG like PPIA and RPL19 and novel potential markers for human AT and discarding others like the extensively used 18S gene due to a sex-based variability display in adipose tissue. Orthologs have also been assayed and proposed for mouse WAT suHKG signature. All results generated during this study are readily available by accessing an open web resource (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG) for consultation and reuse in further studies.\n\nConclusionsThis sex-based research proves that certain classical housekeeping genes fail to function adequately as controls when analyzing human adipose tissue considering sex as a variable.

While cohesion establishment and mitotic cohesion dissolution have already been explored, the regulation of cohesin loading is not as well understood. Here, we report that the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase NSD3 is an essential factor in sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic progression, and that this occurs before and not after entry into mitosis. We establish that NSD3 interacts with the cohesin loader complex kollerin (NIPBL/MAU2), and that at mitotic exit it ensures proper levels of both MAU2 and cohesin itself on chromatin. In accordance with this newly described function in cohesin loading, we also show that NSD3 associates with chromatin in early anaphase, prior to the loading recruitment of MAU2 and RAD21, and that it then dissociates from chromatin when prophase begins. Going further, we also demonstrate that of the two NSD3 variants existing in somatic cells, it is the long isoform that is responsible for regulating kollerin and cohesin chromatin-loading, and that this isoforms methyltransferase activity is required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. Based on these observations, we propose that NSD3-dependent methylation contributes to sister chromatid cohesion by ensuring the proper recruitment of kollerin and thus loading of cohesin.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2021.12.16.472961"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.01.04.474899", "title": "Transglutaminase mediated asprosin oligomerization allows its tissue storage as fibers", "authors": "Morcos, Y.

Although derived upon C-terminal cleavage of fibrillin-1, a multidomain extracellular matrix glycoprotein with a ubiquitous distribution in connective tissues, little is known about the mechanisms controlling the bioavailability of asprosin in tissues. In the current view, asprosin is mainly produced by white adipose tissue from where it is released into the blood in monomeric form. Here, by employing newly generated specific asprosin antibodies we monitored the distribution pattern of asprosin in human and murine connective tissues such as placenta, and muscle. Thereby we detected the presence of asprosin positive extracellular fibers. Further, by screening established cell lines for asprosin synthesis we found that most cells derived from musculoskeletal tissues render asprosin into an oligomerized form.

The model is parameterized to reproduce the experimental Hi-C map of the wild type (WT) nuclei; it describes time evolution of the chromatin over the G1 phase of the interphase. Best agreement with the experiment is achieved when the simulations include an ensemble of nuclei, corresponding to the experimentally observed set of several possible mutual arrangements of chromosomal arms. The model is validated against multiple structural features of chromatin from several different experiments not used in model development, including those that describe changes in chromatin induced by lamin depletion. Predicted positioning of all LADs at the NE is highly dynamic - the same LAD can attach, detach and move far away from the NE multiple times during interphase. The probabilities of LADs to be in contact with the NE vary by an order of magnitude, despite all having the same affinity to the NE in the model. These probabilities are mostly determined by a highly variable local linear density of LADs along the genome which also has a strong effect on the predicted radial positioning of individual TADs. Higher probability of a TAD to be near NE is largely determined by a higher linear density of LADs surrounding this TAD. The distribution of LADs along the chromosome chains plays a notable role in maintaining a non-random average global structure of chromatin. Relatively high affinity of LADs to the NE in the WT nuclei substantially reduces sensitivity of the global radial chromatin distribution to variations in the strength of TAD-TAD interactions compared to the lamin depleted nuclei, where a 0.5 kT increase of cross-type TAD-TAD interactions doubles the chromatin density in the central nucleus region.\n\nConclusionsA dynamical model of the entire fruit fly genome makes multiple genome-wide predictions of biological interest.

Many computational approaches have been developed to repurpose existing drugs to meet this need. However, these tools often output long lists of candidate drugs that are difficult to interpret, and individual drug candidates may suffer from unknown off-target effects. We reasoned that an approach which aggregates information from multiple drugs that share a common mechanism of action (MOA) would increase on-target signal compared to evaluating drugs on an individual basis. In this study, we present Drug Mechanism Enrichment Analysis (DMEA), an adaptation of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which groups drugs with shared MOAs to improve the prioritization of drug repurposing candidates.\n\nRESULTSFirst, we tested DMEA on simulated data and showed that it can sensitively and robustly identify an enriched drug MOA. Next, we used DMEA on three types of rank-ordered drug lists: (1) perturbagen signatures based on gene expression data, (2) drug sensitivity scores based on high-throughput cancer cell line screening, and (3) molecular classification scores of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. In each case, DMEA detected the expected MOA as well as other relevant MOAs. Furthermore, the rankings of MOAs generated by DMEA were better than the original single-drug rankings in all tested data sets. Finally, in a drug discovery experiment, we identified potential senescence-inducing and senolytic drug MOAs for primary human mammary epithelial cells and then experimentally validated the senolytic effects of EGFR inhibitors.\n\nCONCLUSIONSDMEA is a fast and versatile bioinformatic tool that can improve the prioritization of candidates for drug repurposing.

Here, we combined electrophysiological recordings with molecular dynamics based, in silico electrophysiology simulations, to study selectivity filter gating in the model potassium channel MthK and its V55E mutant (analogous to KcsA E71) in the pore-helix. Experimentally, we find that MthK V55E has a lower open probability than the WT channel, due to decreased stability of the open state, as well as a lower unitary conductance. Simulations account for both aspects of these observations on the atomistic scale, showing that ion permeation in V55E is altered by two distinct orientations of the E55 side chain. In the  vertical orientation of E55, in which E55 forms a hydrogen bond with D64 (as observed with KcsA WT channels), the filter displays reduced conductance compared to MthK WT. In contrast, with  horizontal orientation, K+ conductance is closer to MthK WT; however the selectivity filter stability in the conducting conformation is lowered, and the filter more readily transitions to the inactivated conformation. Surprisingly, these transitions of MthK WT and V55E channels to the non-conducting (inactivated) state observed in simulations are associated with a widening selectivity filter, unlike its narrowing seen in KcsA, and reminisce the recent structures of stably-inactivated, voltage-gated potassium channels: Shaker W434F and Kv1.2 W362F mutants, as well as WT Kv1.3 channels.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/14/2022.03.29.486236"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.03.30.486382", "title": "CUT&Tag recovers up to half of ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks in modifications of H3K27", "authors": "Hu, D.; Abbasova, L.; Schilder, B.

Next, we generated tamoxifen-induced Col1a2-Cre-ERT2::Mmp14 KO mice (Mmp14 conditional knockout (CKO)).

In Mmp14 CKO mice 19 proteins had reversed temporal abundance and 176 proteins lost time dependency. Among these, the collagen crosslinking enzymes lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) and lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1; encoded by Plod2) were elevated and had lost time-dependent regulation. High-pressure chromatography confirmed elevated levels of hydroxylysine aldehyde (pyridinoline) crosslinking of collagen in CKO tendons. As a result, collagen-I was refractory to extraction.

Estimates of variance components derived from linear mixed models demonstrated that the phenotypic variation due to genotype by location interaction effects was greater than genotype by year interaction effects.

We demonstrate that direct inter-endosomal contact drives the maturation from very early (APPL1-positive) to early (EEA1-positive) endosomes. Using fluorescence lifetime, we show that this endosomal interaction is underpinned by the asymmetric binding of EEA1 to very early and early endosomes through the N- and C-termini, respectively. Thus, stochastic microtubule-mediated inter-endosomal interactions through EEA1 provide a mechanism to bring temporal and population- level control to the process of endosome maturation.

One potential contributor to these balance deficits is a decreased ability to modulate mediolateral stepping behavior based on pelvis motion. This behavior, hereby termed mediolateral step modulation, is thought to be an important balance strategy but can be disrupted in PwCS.\n\nResearch QuestionAre biomechanical metrics of mediolateral step modulation related to common clinical balance measures among PwCS?\n\nMethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 93 PwCS walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed for 3-minutes. We quantified mediolateral step modulation for both paretic and non-paretic steps by calculating partial correlations between mediolateral pelvis displacement at the start of each step and step width ({rho}SW), mediolateral foot placement relative to the pelvis ({rho}FP), and final mediolateral location of the pelvis ({rho}PD) at the end of the step. We also assessed several common clinical balance measures (Functional Gait Assessment [FGA], Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale [ABC], self-reported fear of falling and fall history). We performed Spearman correlations to relate each biomechanical metric of step modulation to FGA and ABC scores. We performed Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare each biomechanical metric between individuals with and without a fear of falling and a history of falls.\n\nResultsOnly {rho}FP for paretic steps was significantly related to all four clinical balance measures; higher paretic {rho}FP values tended to be observed in participants with higher FGA scores, with higher ABC scores, without a fear of falling and without a history of falls. However, the strength of each of these relationships was only weak to moderate.\n\nSignificanceWhile the present results do not provide insight into causality, they justify future work investigating whether interventions designed to increase {rho}FP can improve clinical measures of post-stroke balance in parallel.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2022.04.26.489530"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.04.27.489829", "title": "scTopoGAN: Unsupervised manifold alignment of single-cell data", "authors": "Singh, A.; Reinders, M.; Mahfouz, A.; Abdelaal, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tamim  Abdelaal", "author_corresponding_institution": "Leiden University Medical Center", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "Single-cell technologies allow deep characterization of different molecular aspects of cells.

Because PKA signaling is the predominantly activated pathway in the TGAC8 left ventricle (LV) performance and protection circuitry, we hypothesized that phosphorylation states of numerous proteins are increased in pathways in which the transcriptome and proteome were activated TGAC8 vs. WT. We conducted an unbiased phosphoproteomics analysis in order to determine the role of altered protein phosphorylation in the chronic adaptive heart performance and protection profile of adult TGAC8 LV at 3-4 months of age. We identified 12,963 phospho-peptides and 3646 phosphoproteins, including 4990 upregulated phosphopeptides and 781 differentially regulated (741 Up and 40 Down) phosphoproteins in TGAC8 vs. WT. Based on differentially regulated phosphoproteins by genotype, numerous stress response canonical pathways within reprogrammed TGAC8 LV, including protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, PI3K signaling, and AMPK signaling, predicted upstream regulators, e.g., PDPK1, PAK1 and PTK2B, and downstream functions, e.g., cell viability, protein quality control, and metabolism were enriched. In addition to PKA, numerous kinases (83) and phosphatases (30) were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs. WT. Hyper-phosphorylated transcriptional factors in TGAC8 were associated with increased mRNA transcription, and immune responses and metabolism pathways. Combining the phosphoproteome with its proteome and with the previously published TGAC8 transcriptome enabled the elucidation of which cardiac performance and adaptive protection profiles were coordinately regulated at post-translational modification (PTM) (phosphorylation), translational and transcriptional levels. Many stress response signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK and ubiquitin labeling, were consistently enriched at transcriptional, translational and PTM levels, and that PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways were also activated in the TGAC8 LV. We verified some results via western blot and protein synthesis and degradation detection experiments. Thus, PTM of protein by phosphorylation, per se, contributes immensely to the heart performance and protection profile of TGAC8 LV, and is coordinately regulated with altered transcription and translation in the TGAC8 to activate critical stress response pathways.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/21/2022.04.29.488779"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.05.03.490537", "title": "A model of decentralized vision in the sea urchin Diadema africanum", "authors": "Li, T.; Kirwan, J.; Arnone, M.

Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40-nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelganger Simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak non-ergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, cytoskeletal effects, cell cycle stage and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not \"well-mixed\" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40-nm sizescale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population. These findings carry significant implications for the origins and regulation of biological noise at cellular and subcellular levels.\n\nSignificanceBiophysical properties of the cytoplasm influence many cellular processes, from differentiation to cytoskeletal dynamics, yet little is known about how tightly cells control these properties. We developed a combined experimental and computational approach to analyze cytoplasmic heterogeneity through the lens of diffusion. We find that the apparent cytoplasmic viscosity varies tremendously - over 100-fold within any individual cell, and over 10-fold among individual cells when comparing averages of all particles measured for each cell. The variance was largely independent of temperature, the cytoskeleton, cell cycle stage, and localization, but was magnified under hyperosmotic shock. This suggests that cytoplasmic heterogeneity contributes substantially to biological variability within and between cells, and has significant implications for any cellular process that depends on diffusion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/491518v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6faeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a49dc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171d62borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3c7bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2022.05.11.491518"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.05.22.493013", "title": "RAREFAN: A webservice to identify REPINs and RAYTs in bacterial genomes", "authors": "Fortmann-Grote, C.; von Irmer, J.; Bertels, F.", "author_corresponding": "Frederic  Bertels", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "Compared to eukaryotes, repetitive sequences are rare in bacterial genomes and usually do not persist for long.

Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are LROs of endothelial cells and also store VWF and P-selectin. In megakaryocytes, NBEAL2 links P-selectin on AGs to the SNARE protein SEC22B on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby preventing premature release of cargo from AG precursors. In endothelial cells, SEC22B drives VWF trafficking from ER to Golgi and promotes the formation of elongated WPBs, but it is unclear if this requires NBEAL2.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate a potential role for NBEAL2 in WPB biogenesis and VWF secretion using NBEAL2 deficient endothelial cells.\n\nMethodsInteraction of SEC22B with NBEAL2 in endothelial cells was investigated by interactomic mass spectrometry and pull down analysis.

In this work, a novel vision-based CM with CA model (i.e., VCMCA) that is simulating the collective evolution learning process is proposed. In this setting, a learning agent obtains a visual signal about its environment, and throughout trial-and-error over multiple attempts, the individual learns to perform a local CM with CA which emerges into a global CM with CA dynamics.

In humans, copy number variation may be inconsequential, contribute to minor phenotypic differences, or cause conditions such as birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancers. To identify mechanisms that drive copy number variation, we monitored the experimental evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations grown under sulfate-limiting conditions. Cells with increased copy number of the gene SUL1, which encodes a primary sulfate transporter, exhibit a fitness advantage. Previously, we reported interstitial inverted triplications of SUL1 as the dominant rearrangement in a haploid population. Here, in a diploid population, we find instead that small linear fragments containing SUL1 form and are sustained over several generations. Many of the linear fragments are stabilized by de novo telomere addition within a telomere-like sequence near SUL1 (within the SNF5 gene). Using an assay that monitors telomerase action following an induced chromosome break, we show that this region acts as a hotspot of de novo telomere addition and that required sequences map to a region of <250 base pairs. Consistent with previous work showing that association of the telomere-binding protein Cdc13 with internal sequences stimulates telomerase recruitment, mutation of a four-nucleotide motif predicted to associate with Cdc13 abolishes de novo telomere addition.

However, the molecular determinants of such interactions have been challenging to understand, even as genomic, proteomic, and structural data grows. This knowledge gap has been a major obstacle for the comprehensive understanding of cellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and for the de novo design of protein binders that are crucial for synthetic biology and translational applications. We exploit a geometric deep learning framework operating on protein surfaces that generates fingerprints to describe geometric and chemical features critical to drive PPIs. We hypothesized these fingerprints capture the key aspects of molecular recognition that represent a new paradigm in the computational design of novel protein interactions. As a proof-of-principle, we computationally designed several de novo protein binders to engage four protein targets: SARS-CoV-2 spike, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Several designs were experimentally optimized while others were purely generated in silico, reaching nanomolar affinity with structural and mutational characterization showing highly accurate predictions. Overall, our surface-centric approach captures the physical and chemical determinants of molecular recognition, enabling a novel approach for the de novo design of protein interactions and, more broadly, of artificial proteins with function.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2022.06.16.496402"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.06.19.496644", "title": "Dynein dysfunction prevents maintenance of high concentrations of slow axonal transport cargos at the axon terminal: a computational study", "authors": "Kuznetsov, I.

We are motivated by reports that mutations in dynein-encoding genes can cause diseases associated with peripheral motor and sensory neurons, such as type 2O Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We use two different models to simulate bidirectional transport in an axon: an anterograde-retrograde model, which neglects passive transport by diffusion in the cytosol, and a full slow transport model, which includes passive transport by diffusion in the cytosol. As dynein is a retrograde motor, dysfunction should not directly influence anterograde transport. However, our modeling results unexpectedly predict that slow axonal transport fails to transport cargos against their concentration gradient without dynein. The reason is the lack of a physical mechanism for the reverse information flow from the axon terminal, which is required so that the cargo concentration at the terminal could influence the cargo concentration distribution in the axon. Mathematically speaking, to achieve a prescribed concentration at the terminal, equations governing cargo transport must allow for the imposition of a boundary condition postulating the cargo concentration at the terminal. Perturbation analysis for the case when the retrograde motor velocity becomes close to zero predicts uniform cargo distributions along the axon. The obtained results explain why slow axonal transport must be bidirectional to allow for the maintenance of concentration gradients along the axon length. Our result is limited to small cargo diffusivity, which is a reasonable assumption for many slow axonal transport cargos (such as cytosolic and cytoskeletal proteins, neurofilaments, actin, and microtubules) which are transported as large multiprotein complexes or polymers.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2022.06.19.496644"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.06.20.496912", "title": "High-throughput phenotyping of infection by diverse microsporidia species reveals a wild C. elegans strain with opposing resistance and susceptibility traits", "authors": "Mok, C.; Xiao, M.

However, the stochastic aspect of neuronal activity and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) challenges TMS thresholding methods. We analyzed existing methods for obtaining TMS motor thresholds and their variations, introduced new methods from other fields, and compared their accuracy and speed.\n\nApproachIn addition to existing relative-frequency-based methods, such as the five-out-of-ten method and related approximation of the probability definition of TMS threshold, we examined adaptive methods based on a probabilistic motor threshold model and maximum-likelihood (ML) or maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation. To improve the performance of the adaptive estimation methods, we explored variations in the estimation procedure and inclusion of population-level prior information. We adapted a Bayesian estimation method which iteratively incorporated information of the TMS responses into the probability density function. A family of non-parametric stochastic root-finding methods with different convergence criteria and stepping rules were explored as well. The performance of the thresholding methods was evaluated with an independent stochastic MEP model.\n\nMain ResultsThe conventional relative-frequency methods required a large number of stimuli and, despite good accuracy on the population level, had wide error distributions for individual subjects. The parametric estimation methods obtained the thresholds much faster, and their accuracy depended on the estimation method, with performance significantly improved when population-level prior information is included. Stochastic root-finding methods were comparable to adaptive estimation methods but were much simpler to implement and did not rely on an underlying estimation model.\n\nSignificanceTwo-parameter MAP estimation, Bayesian estimation, and stochastic root-finding methods require fewer TMS pulses for accurate estimation than conventional relative-frequency and single-parameter ML estimation. Stochastic root finding appears particularly attractive due to the low computational requirements, simplicity of the algorithmic implementation, and independence from potential model flaws in the parametric estimators.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2022.06.26.495134"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.06.26.497658", "title": "Characterizing the landscape of viral expression in cancer by deep learning", "authors": "Elbasir, A.; Ye, Y.; Schaffer, D.

These interactions and correlations can be hard to establish in humans, due to the difficulties of routine sampling and controlling for individual differences (e.g., diet, socio-economic status, medication). Because bottlenose dolphins are long-lived mammals that exhibit several age-related phenomena similar to humans, we analyzed data from a well controlled 25-year longitudinal cohort of 144 dolphins. The data from this study has been reported on earlier, and consists of 44 clinically relevant biomarkers. This time-series data exhibits three starkly different influences: (A) directed interactions between biomarkers, (B) sources of biological variation that can either correlate or decorrelate different biomarkers, and (C) random observation-noise which combines measurement error and very rapid fluctuations in the dolphins biomarkers. Importantly, the sources of biological variation (type-B) are large in magnitude, often comparable to the observation errors (type-C) and larger than the effect of the directed interactions (type-A). Attempting to recover the type-A interactions without accounting for the type-B and type-C variation can result in an abundance of false-positives and false-negatives. Using a generalized regression which fits the longitudinal data with a linear model accounting for all three influences, we demonstrate that the dolphins exhibit many significant directed interactions (type-A), as well as strong correlated variation (type-B), between several pairs of biomarkers. Moreover, many of these interactions are associated with advanced age, suggesting that these interactions can be monitored and/or targeted to predict and potentially affect aging.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/12/2022.06.28.497095"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.07.01.498513", "title": "State-specific morphological deformations of the lipid bilayer explain mechanosensitive gating of MscS ion channels", "authors": "Park, Y.

Here, we investigate the molecular basis for this transduction mechanism by studying the mechanosensitive ion channel MscS from Escherichia coli and its eukaryotic homolog, MSL1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. First, we use single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structure of a novel open conformation of wild-type MscS, stabilized in a thinned lipid nanodisc. Compared with the closed state, the structure shows a reconfiguration of helices TM1, TM2 and TM3a, and widening of the central pore. Based on these structures, we examined how the morphology of the lipid bilayer is altered upon gating, using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal that closed-state MscS causes drastic protrusions in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, both in the absence and presence of lateral tension, and for different lipid compositions. These deformations arise to provide adequate solvation to hydrophobic features of the protein surface in this conformation, and clearly reflect a high energy conformation for the membrane, particularly under tension. Strikingly, these protrusions are largely eradicated upon channel opening. An analogous computational study of open and closed MSL1 recapitulates these findings. The gating equilibrium of MscS channels thus appears to be dictated by two opposing conformational preferences, namely those of the lipid membrane and of the protein structure. We propose a membrane deformation model of mechanosensation, which posits that tension shifts the gating equilibrium towards the conductive state not because it alters the mode in which channel and lipids interact but because it increases the energetic cost of the morphological perturbations in the membrane induced by to the closed state.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2022.07.01.498513"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.07.03.498634", "title": "Tissue-specific regulation of gene expression via unproductive splicing", "authors": "Mironov, A.; Vlasenok, M.; Margasyuk, S.; Mironov, A.

A mathematical model is typically constructed using expert knowledge and informal reasoning to generate a mechanistic explanation for a given observation. Although this approach works well for simple systems with abundant data and well-established principles, quantitative biology is often faced with a dearth of both data and knowledge about a process, thus making it challenging to identify and validate all possible mechanistic hypothesis underlying a system behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Bayesian multimodel inference (Bayes-MMI) methodology, which quantifies how mechanistic hypotheses can explain a given experimental datasets, and concurrently, how each dataset informs a given model hypothesis, thus enabling hypothesis space exploration in the context of available data. We demonstrate this approach to probe standing questions about heterogeneity, lineage plasticity, and cell-cell interactions in tumor growth mechanisms of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We integrate three datasets that each formulated different explanations for tumor growth mechanisms in SCLC, apply Bayes-MMI and find that the data supports model predictions for tumor evolution promoted by high lineage plasticity, rather than through expanding rare stem-like populations. In addition, the models predict that in the presence of SCLC-N or SCLC-A2 cells, the transition from SCLC-A to SCLC-Y through an intermediate is decelerated. Together, these predictions provide a testable hypothesis for observed juxtaposed results in SCLC growth and a mechanistic interpretation for tumor recalcitrance.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTo make a mathematical model, an investigator needs to know and incorporate biological relationships present in the system of interest. However, if we dont know the exact relationships, how can we build a model? Building a single model may include spurious relationships or exclude important ones, so model selection enables us to build multiple, incorporating various combinations of biological features and the relationships between them. Each biological feature represents a distinct hypothesis, which can be investigated via model fitting to experimental data. We aim to improve upon the information theoretic framework of model selection by incorporating Bayesian elements. We apply our approach to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), using multiple datasets, to address hypotheses about cell-cell interactions, phenotypic transitions, and tumor makeup across experimental model systems. Incorporating Bayesian inference, we can add into model selection an assessment of whether these hypotheses are likely or unlikely, or even whether the data enables assessment of a hypothesis at all. Our analysis finds that SCLC is likely highly plastic, with cells able to transition phenotypic identities easily. These predictions could help explain why SCLC is such a difficult disease to treat, and provide the basis for further experiments.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2022.07.22.500696"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.07.26.501605", "title": "Protein Complexes in cells by AI-assisted structural proteomics", "authors": "O'Reilly, F.

The programs were used to compare the structures of two sets of  Never Born proteins that had been expressed - Group 1, which had been shown experimentally to possess substantial secondary structure, and Group 3, which had been shown to be intrinsically disordered. Overall, the models generated were scored as being of low quality but revealed some general principles. Specifically, all four members of Group 1 were predicted to be compact by all three algorithms. The members of Group 3 were predicted to be very extended, as would be expected for intrinsically disordered proteins. The three programs were then used to predict the structures of three orphan proteins whose crystal structures had been solved, two of which display novel folds. Finally, they were used to predict the structures of seven orphan proteins with well-identified biological functions, whose 3D structures are not known. Two proteins, which were predicted to be disordered based on their sequences, are predicted by all three structure algorithms to be extended structures. The other five were predicted to be compact structures with two exceptions in the case of AlphaFold2. All three prediction algorithms make remarkably similar and high-quality predictions for one large protein, HCO_11565, from a nematode. It is conjectured that this is due to many homologs in the taxonomically restricted family of which it is a member and to the fact that the Dali server revealed several non-related proteins with similar folds. Overall, orphan and taxonomically restricted proteins are often predicted to have compact 3D structures, sometimes with a novel fold that is a consequence of their novel sequences, which are associated with the appearance of new biological functions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/11/2022.08.02.502493"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.08.02.502533", "title": "Resurrecting the Alternative Splicing Landscape of Archaic Hominins using Machine Learning", "authors": "Brand, C.

We discover 5,950 putative archaic SAVs, of which 2,186 are archaic-specific and 3,607 also occur in modern humans via introgression (244) or shared ancestry (3,520). Archaic-specific SAVs are enriched in genes that contribute to many traits potentially relevant to hominin phenotypic divergence, such as the epidermis, respiration, and spinal rigidity. Compared to shared SAVs, archaic-specific SAVs occur in sites under weaker selection and are more common in genes with tissue-specific expression. Further underscoring the importance of negative selection on SAVs, Neanderthal lineages with low effective population sizes are enriched for SAVs compared to Denisovan and shared SAVs. Finally, we find that nearly all introgressed SAVs in humans were shared across Neanderthals, suggesting that older SAVs were more tolerated in modern human genomes.

The microplate reader allowed us to capture signals of ratiometric fluorescent reporter proteins (FRPs) with a high sensitivity and thereby to further improve the analysis of internal pH via the pH-sensitive FRP mCherryEA in Escherichia coli colonies. Applicability of this novel technique was further demonstrated by assessing redox states in C. glutamicum colonies using the FRP Mrx1-roGFP2. By the use of a microplate reader, oxidative redox shifts were measured in a mutant strain lacking the non-enzymatic antioxidant mycothiol (MSH), indicating its major role for maintaining a reduced redox state also in colonies on agar plates.

Previous studies found that shallow and deep MDD phenotypes have qualitatively distinct genetic architectures, but it remains unclear which are optimal for scientific study or clinical prediction. We propose a new framework to get the best of both worlds by integrating together information across hundreds of MDD-relevant phenotypes. First, we use phenotype imputation to increase sample size for the deepest available MDD phenotype, which dramatically improves GWAS power (increases #loci ~10 fold) and PRS accuracy (increases R2 ~2 fold). Further, we show the genetic architecture of the imputed phenotype remains specific to MDD using genetic correlation, PRS prediction in external clinical cohorts, and a novel PRS-based pleiotropy metric. We also develop a complementary approach to improve specificity of GWAS on shallow MDD phenotypes by adjusting for phenome-wide PCs. Finally, we study phenotype integration at the level of GWAS summary statistics, which can increase GWAS and PRS power but introduces non-MDD-specific signals.

While the complete assembly of these regions in the Telomere-to-Telomere consortiums CHM13 provided a model of their homology (Nurk et al. 2022), it remained unclear if these patterns were ancestral or maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here, we show that acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs) indicative of recombination between non-homologs. Considering an all-to-all comparison of the high-quality human pangenome from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) (Liao et al. 2022), we find that contigs from all of the acrocentric short arms form a community similar to those formed by single chromosomes or the sex chromosome pair. A variation graph (Garrison et al. 2018) constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs indicates the presence of regions where most contigs appear nearly identical between heterologous CHM13 acrocentrics. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of linkage disequilibrium in the PHRs than in the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of recombination (N. Li and Stephens 2003; Huttley et al. 1999).

The white-tailed deer is currently expanding, while caribou are in the midst of a significant decline. Mountain goats remain stable, having suffered a large historical bottleneck. We assessed genome-wide signatures of inbreeding using the inbreeding coefficient F and %ROH (FROH) and identified evolutionarily constrained regions with GERP. Mutational load was estimated by identifying mutations in highly constrained elements (CEs) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) mutations. Our results show that F and FROH are higher in mountain goats than in caribou and white-tailed deer. Given the extended bottleneck and low Ne of the mountain goat, this supports the idea that the genome-wide effects of demographic change take time to accrue. Similarly, we found that mountain goats possess more highly constrained CEs and the lowest dN/dS values, both of which are indicative of greater purifying selection; this is also reflected by fewer mutations in CEs and deleterious mutations identified by SIFT. In contrast, white-tailed deer presented the highest mutational load with both metrics, in addition to dN/dS, while caribou were intermediate.

Both the plateau and the additional frequency dependency {propto} (- i\\{omega})[1/2] of ATP-depleted cells are consistent with a rheological response typical of colloidal jamming.

However, genome-wide G4s characterized through high-throughput sequencing suggest that these structures form at a large number of regions with no such canonical G4-forming signatures. Many G4-binding proteins have been described with no evidence for any protein that binds to and stabilizes G4s. It remains unknown what fraction of G4s formed in human cells are protein-bound. The G4-chromatin immunoprecipitation (G4-ChIP) method hitherto employed to describe G4 landscapes preferentially reports G4s that get crosslinked to proteins in their proximity. Our current understanding of the G4 landscape is biased against representation of G4s which escape crosslinking as they are not stabilized by protein-binding and presumably transient. We report a protocol that captures G4s from the cells efficiently without any bias as well as eliminates the detection of G4s formed artifactually on crosslinked sheared chromatin post-fixation. We discover that G4s form sparingly at SINEs. An application of this method shows that depletion of a repeat-binding protein CGGBP1 enhances net G4 capture at CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites and regions of sharp interstrand G/C-skew transitions. Thus, we present an improved method for G4 landscape determination and by applying it we show that sequence property-specific constraints of the nuclear environment mitigate G4 formation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2022.09.03.506459"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.08.507079", "title": "Empirical methods for the validation of Time-To-Event mathematical models taking into account uncertainty and variability: Application to EGFR+ Lung Adenocarcinoma.", "authors": "Jacob, E.; Perrillat-Mercerot, A.; Palgen, J.-L.; L'Hostis, A.; Ceres, N.; Boissel, J.-P.; Bosley, J.; Monteiro, C.; Kahoul, R.", "author_corresponding": "Evgueni Jacob", "author_corresponding_institution": "Novadiscovery", "date": "2023-01-24", "category": "systems biology", "abstract": "Over the past several decades, metrics have been defined to assess the quality of various types of models and to compare their performance depending on their capacity to explain the variance found in real-life data.

How could then cells form liquid-like condensates while avoiding their transformation to amyloids? Here we show how post-translational phosphorylation can provide a \"handle\" that prevents liquid-solid transition of intracellular condensates containing FUS. Using residue-specific coarse-grained simulations, for 85 different mammalian FUS sequences, we show how the number of phosphorylation sites and their spatial arrangement affect intracluster dynamics preventing conversion to amyloids. All atom simulations further confirm that phosphorylation can effectively reduce the {beta}-sheet propensity in amyloid-prone fragments of FUS. A detailed evolutionary analysis shows that mammalian FUS PLDs are enriched in amyloid-prone stretches compared to control neutrally evolved sequences suggesting that mammalian FUS proteins evolved to self-assemble. However, in stark contrast to proteins that do not phase-separate for their function, mammalian sequences have phosphosites in close proximity to these amyloid-prone regions. These results suggest that evolution uses amyloid-prone sequences in prion-like domains to enhance phase-separation of condensate proteins while enriching phosphorylation sites in close proximity to safe-guard against liquid-solid transitions.\n\nSignificance StatementIntrinsically disordered regions and prion-like domains are widely observed in proteins that get enriched in membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Mammalian Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) sequences are significantly enriched in amyloid-prone sequences suggesting that they have evolved to self-assemble. While the amyloid-prone stretches promote self-assembly of these proteins at lower threshold concentrations, these assemblies are vulnerable to aberrant liquid-solid phase transitions. Molecular simulations and bioinformatics analyses show that evolution overcomes this challenge by placing phosphosites specifically close to amyloid-prone stretches. Introduction of negatively charged residues at phosphosite locations results in fewer amyloid-prone contacts and thereby lower beta-sheet propensity. Phosphorylation can thus allow cells to utilize amyloid-prone stretches to promote biogenesis of MLOs while protecting against liquid-solid transitions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2022.09.15.508150"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.14.508015", "title": "Transcriptional patterns of sexual dimorphism and in host developmental programs in the model parasitic nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri", "authors": "Pollo, S.

While draft genome sequences are available for this worm, which allow for comparative genomic analyses between nematodes, there is a notable lack of information on its gene expression. Here, we have generated biologically replicated RNA-seq datasets from samples taken throughout the parasitic life of H. bakeri. We find extensive transcriptional sexual dimorphism throughout the fourth larval and adult stages of this parasite and identify alternative splicing, glycosylation, and ubiquitination as particularly important processes for establishing and/or maintaining sex-specific gene expression in this species. Further, we find sex-linked differences in transcription related to aging and oxidative and osmotic stress responses. Additionally, we observe a starvation-like signature among transcripts whose expression is consistently up-regulated in males, which may reflect a higher energy expenditure by male worms. We detect evidence of increased importance for anaerobic respiration among the adult worms, which coincides with the parasites migration into the physiologically hypoxic environment of the intestinal lumen. Further, we hypothesize that oxygen concentration may be an important driver of the worms encysting in the intestinal mucosa as larvae, which not only fully exposes the worms to their hosts immune system, but also shapes many of the interactions between the host and parasite. We find stage- and sex-specific variation in the expression of immunomodulatory genes and in anthelmintic targets. In addition to generating new hypotheses for follow-up experiments into the worms behaviour, physiology, and metabolism, our datasets enable future more in-depth comparisons between nematodes to better define the utility of H. bakeri as a model for parasitic nematodes in general.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasitic nematodes (roundworms) that infect humans and livestock are a major health and economic burden but are challenging to study in a laboratory environment because of their required hosts. One strategy to get around this difficulty is to first study a rodent model to guide targeted experiments in the more difficult study system. Heligmosomoides bakeri is closely related to the nematode parasites of humans and livestock and naturally parasitizes mice. We have generated information on the expression of all the genes in this worm throughout the stages of its life when it is parasitic. This information allows us to examine how different the male and female worms are at the molecular level. We also describe major developmental events that occur in the worm, which extend our understanding of the interactions between this parasite and its host. We analyse the expression of genes known to be involved in interfering with host immune responses and others known to be targeted by drugs designed to kill worms. This new information will allow for better comparisons among nematodes to assess how well this rodent model system works for studying parasitic nematodes in general.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2022.09.14.508015"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.21.508743", "title": "Allelic Transcription Factor binding shape transcriptional kinetics observed with scRNA-seq in human cell lines", "authors": "Jin, B.; Feng, H.; Bush, W.", "author_corresponding": "William Bush", "author_corresponding_institution": "Case Western Reserve University", "date": "2023-01-24", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "Gene expression from bulk RNA-seq studies is an average measurement between two chromosomes and across cell populations.

Characterization of recorded transients is often hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Reduction of the noise by filtering has limited use due to partial signal distortion. Occasionally, transients can be approximated by a mathematical function, but such a function may not hold correctly if recording conditions change. We introduce here the model-independent approximation method for general noisy transient signals based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR). The method was implemented in the software TransientAnalyzer, which detects transients in a record, finds their best approximation by the Gaussian process, constructs a surrogate spline function, and estimates specified signal parameters. The method and software were tested on a cellular model of the calcium concentration transient corrupted by various SNR levels and recorded at a low sampling frequency. Statistical analysis of the model data sets provided the error of estimation <7.5% and the coefficient of variation of estimates <17% for peak SNR=5. The performance of GPR on signals of diverse experimental origin was even better than fitting by a function.

As no approved efficacious vaccine exists, available drugs are expensive and/or toxic, and resistance is emerging, management of sand fly populations to break transmission is currently the most effective disease control strategy. To better understand the biology of sand flies, including the mechanisms involved in their vectorial capacity, insecticide resistance, and population structures we sequenced the genomes of two of the most important sand fly species: Phlebotomus papatasi, a cutaneous leishmaniasis vector, (distributed in the Middle East and North Africa) and Lutzomyia longipalpis, a visceral leishmaniasis vector (distributed across Central and South America).

Different Leishmania species present a wide clinical profile, ranging from mild, often self-resolving cutaneous lesions that can lead to protective immunity, to severe metastatic mucosal disease, to visceral disease that is ultimately fatal. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bites of sand flies, and as no approved vaccine exists, available drugs are toxic and/or expensive and resistance is emerging, new dual control strategies to combat these diseases must be developed, combining interventions on human infections and integrated sand fly population management. Effective vector control requires a good understanding of the biology of sand flies. To this end, we sequenced and annotated the genomes of two sand fly species that are important leishmaniasis vectors from the Old and New Worlds. These genomes allow us to better understand, at the genetic level, processes important in the vector biology of these species, such as finding hosts, blood-feeding, immunity, and detoxification.

Many designs exhibit substantial and useful diversity in functional thermostability (up to 96 {degrees}C), fluorescence lifetime, and quantum yield. By eliminating incompatible active-site mutations, htFuncLib generates a large diversity of functional sequences. We envision that htFuncLib will be useful for one-shot optimization of activity in enzymes, binders, and other proteins.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/19/2022.10.11.511732"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.10.12.511987", "title": "Development of novel cytoprotective small compounds inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptosis", "authors": "Matsuyama, S.; Matsuyama, M.; Ortega, J.; Fedorov, Y.; Scott-McKean, J.; Muller-Greven, J.; Buck, M.; Adams, D.; Jastrzebska, B.; Greenlee, W.", "author_corresponding": "Shigemi Matsuyama", "author_corresponding_institution": "Case Western Reserve University", "date": "2023-01-12", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "We identified cyto-protective small molecules (CSMs) by a cell-based high-throughput screening of Bax inhibitors.

The contribution of these three components of SAT was investigated in three different segments of the axon: the proximal portion, the central portion, and the distal portion of the axon. MAP1B protein was used as a model system to study SAT because there are published experimental data reporting MAP1B distribution along the axon length and average velocity of MAP1B transport in the axon. This allows the optimization approach to be used to find values of model kinetic constants that give the best fit with published experimental data. The effects of decreasing the value of cargo diffusivity on the diffusion-driven component of SAT and decreasing the value of dynein velocity on the retrograde motor-driven component of SAT were investigated. We found that for the case when protein diffusivity and dynein velocity are very small, it is possible to obtain an analytical solution to model equations. We found that, in this case, the protein concentration in the axon is uniform. This shows that anterograde motor-driven transport alone cannot simulate a variation of cargo concentration in the axon. Most proteins are non-uniformly distributed in axons. They may exhibit, for example, an increased concentration closer to the synapse.

Our analyses further indicated that Powassan virus lineage II emerged in the northeastern U.S. mostly following a south to north pattern, with a weighted lineage dispersal velocity of ~3 km/year.

In order to enhance ML models to better predict the synthetic promoter strength, we propose EVMP(Extended Vision Mutant Priority), a universal framework which utilize mutation information more effectively. In EVMP, synthetic promoters are equivalently transformed into base promoter and corresponding k-mer mutations, which are input into BaseEncoder and VarEncoder respectively.

EVMP also provides optional data augmentation based on multiple base promoters, which further improved the model performance by 22.2% compared with non-EVMP SOTA record. In further study, extended vision is shown to be essential for EVMP. We also found that EVMP can alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon, which may contribute to its effectiveness.

Commonly used minimizer orders select more k-mers than necessary and therefore provide limited improvement in runtime and memory usage of downstream analysis tasks. The recently introduced universal k-mer hitting sets produce minimizer orders with fewer selected k-mers. Unfortunately, generating compact universal k-mer hitting sets is currently infeasible for k > 13, and thus cannot help in the many applications that require minimizer orders for larger k.\n\nHere, we close the gap of efficient minimizer orders for large values of k by introducing decycling-set-based minimizer orders, new orders based on minimum decycling sets. We show that in practice these new minimizer orders select a number of k-mers comparable to that of minimizer orders based on universal k-mer hitting sets, and can also scale up to larger k.

An efficient and scalable solution to this problem is fundamental for many tasks in bioinformatics.\n\nIn this work, we introduce the spectrum preserving tiling (SPT), a general representation of[R] that specifies how a set of tiles repeatedly occur to spell out the constituent reference sequences in[R] . By encoding the order and positions where tiles occur, SPTs enable the implementation and analysis of a general class of modular indexes. An index over an SPT decomposes the reference indexing problem for k-mers into: (1) a k-mer-to-tile mapping; and (2) a tile-to-occurrence mapping. Recently introduced work to construct and compactly index k-mer sets can be used to efficiently implement the k-mer-to-tile mapping. However, implementing the tile-to-occurrence mapping remains prohibitively costly in terms of space. As reference collections become large, the space requirements of the tile-to-occurrence mapping dominates that of the k-mer-to-tile mapping since the former depends on the amount of total sequence while the latter depends on the number of unique k-mers in[R] .\n\nTo address this, we introduce a class of sampling schemes for SPTs that trade off speed to reduce the size of the tile-to-reference mapping.

In this work, we demonstrate that if one approximates the spatial output of a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation as a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by a mean vector (representing an ensemble-averaged pairwise distance map) and covariance matrix, one can train a generative model to learn the distribution of these parameters across a set of sequences.

Furthermore, by sampling from the masked auto-encoder and transforming the generated samples back into their original high-dimensional space, one can generate realistic, ensemble-averaged pairwise distance maps. These results were demonstrated on coarse-grained simulation data derived from approximately 2000 distinct sequences, each sequence being 24 residues in length and consisting exclusively of glycine, serine, glutamate, and lysine.

As a result, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of transcriptional variance across genes, and how this variance is linked to context-specific gene regulation and gene function. Here, we use 57 large publicly available RNA-seq data sets to investigate the landscape of gene expression variance. These studies cover a wide range of tissues and allowed us to assess if there are consistently more or less variable genes across tissues and data sets and what mechanisms drive these patterns. We show that gene expression variance is broadly similar across tissues and studies, indicating that the pattern of transcriptional variance is consistent. We use this similarity to create both global and within-tissue rankings of variation, which we use to show that function, sequence variation, and gene regulatory signatures contribute to gene expression variance. Low-variance genes are associated with fundamental cell processes and have lower levels of genetic polymorphisms, have higher gene-gene connectivity, and tend to be associated with chromatin states associated with transcription. In contrast, high-variance genes are enriched for genes involved in immune response, environmentally responsive genes, immediate early genes, and are associated with higher levels of polymorphisms. These results show that the pattern of transcriptional variance is not noise. Instead, it is a consistent gene trait that seems to be functionally constrained in human populations. Furthermore, this commonly neglected aspect of molecular phenotypic variation harbors important information to understand complex traits and disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryGene expression variance, or the variation in the level of gene expression within a population, can have significant impacts on physiology, disease, and evolutionary adaptations. While the average level of gene expression is typically the focus of research, the variation around this average level (i.e., gene expression variance) can also be important for understanding complex traits and disease. Here, we investigate the landscape of transcriptional variance across tissues, populations, and studies. Using large publicly available RNA-seq data sets, we were able to identify the general properties associated with high- and low-variance genes, as well as factors driving variation in variance across genes. Specifically, we uncovered gene expression variance was significantly associated with gene length, nucleotide diversity, the degree of connectivity and the presence of noncoding RNA. Our results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for maintaining optimal levels of variation in high- versus low-variance differ, and that this variability is the result of different patterns of selection.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/09/2022.11.15.516646"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.17.516906", "title": "Adaptation to ex vivo culture drives human haematopoietic stem cell loss of repopulation capacity in a cell cycle independent manner", "authors": "Johnson, C.

In metazoans, plants, and many filamentous fungi, facultative heterochromatin is characterized by transcriptional repression and enrichment with nucleosomes that are trimethylated at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion of kmt5, the gene encoding the sole methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 methylation, resulted in global derepression of transcription, especially in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Reversal of silencing in the absence of H4K20me3 not only affected genes but also a large number of novel, previously undetected, non-coding transcripts generated from regions of facultative heterochromatin on accessory chromosomes. Transcriptional activation in kmt5 deletion strains was accompanied by a complete loss of Ash1-mediated H3K36me3 and chromatin reorganization affecting H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 distribution in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Strains with a H4K20M mutation in the single histone H4 gene of Z. tritici recapitulated these chromatin changes, suggesting that H4K20me3 is essential for Ash1-mediated H3K36me3. The {Delta}kmt5 mutants we obtained are more sensitive to genotoxic stressors and both, {Delta}kmt5 and {Delta}ash1, showed greatly increased rates of accessory chromosome loss. Taken together, our results provide insights into a novel, and unsuspected, mechanism controlling the assembly and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin.\n\nSignificanceFacultative heterochromatin contains genes important for specific developmental or life cycle stages. Transcriptional regulation of these genes is influenced by chromatin structure.

We developed an artery-on-a-chip with the objective to recapitulate the structure of the arterial wall composed of intimal and medial layers and the relevant hemodynamic forces that affect luminal cells. Results: By comparing arteries-on-chips exposed either to in vivo-like shear stress values or kept in static conditions, we identified a panel of novel genes modulated by shear stress. We next measured the expression pattern of shear stress-modulated genes in areas of the vascular tree affected by atherosclerotic plaques and aortic aneurysms, where disease development and progression are induced by alterations of shear stress. We obtained biopsies from patients affected by carotid artery disease (CAD), comprising the atherosclerotic plaque (diseased artery) and the adjacent region (non-diseased artery). From patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), we obtained the aneurysmal portion (diseased aorta) and non-dilated adjacent segment (non-diseased aorta). Genes modulated by shear stress followed the same expression pattern in non-diseased segments of human vessels and were expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence analysis and single cell RNA sequencing. Using mice and porcine models of vascular CAD and AAA, we confirmed that shear stress mediated targets are important in discriminating diseased and non-diseased vessel portions in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that our artery-on-a-chip can serve as a platform for drug-testing. We were able to reproduce the effects of a therapeutic agent previously used in AAA animal models in artery-on-a-chip systems and extend our understanding of its therapeutic effect through a multicellular structure. Conclusions: Our novel in vitro model is capable of mimicking important physiological aspects of human arteries, such as the response to shear stress, and can further shed light on the mechanism of action of potential therapeutics before they enter the clinical stage.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2022.11.29.517312"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518334", "title": "The Effect of Anesthesia Gases on the Oxygen Reduction Reaction", "authors": "Gupta, A.; Sang, Y.; Fontanesi, C.; Turin, L.; Naaman, R.", "author_corresponding": "Ron Naaman", "author_corresponding_institution": "Weizmann Institute of Science", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of high importance, among others because of its role in cellular respiration and in the operation of fuel cells.

While this process is in principle forbidden because of spin conservation, it is known that if the electrons transferred in the ORR are spin polarized, the reaction occurs efficiently.

We present the first comprehensive study of histone-lysine and DNA methyltransferases across the Mucoromycota, emphasizing heterochromatin formation pathways that rely on the Clr4 complex involved in H3K9-methylation, the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 driving H3K27-methylation, or DNMT1-like methyl-transferases that catalyze 5mC DNA methylation. Our analysis uncovered H3K9-methylated heterochromatin as the major chromatin modification repressing transcription in these fungi, which lack both Polycomb silencing and cytosine methylation. Although small RNAs generated by RNAi pathways facilitate the formation of heterochromatin in many eukaryotic organisms, we show that RNAi is not required to maintain either genomic or centromeric heterochromatin in Mucor. H3K9-methylation and RNAi act independently to control centromeric regions, suggesting a functional sub-specialization. Whereas the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and heterochromatin formation are essential for cell viability, RNAi is dispensable for viability yet acts as the main epigenetic, regulatory force repressing transposition of centromeric GremLINE1 elements. Mutations inactivating canonical RNAi lead to rampant transposition and insertional inactivation of targets resulting in antimicrobial drug resistance. This fine-tuned, Rdrp2-dependent RNAi activity is critical for genome stability, restricting GremLINE1 retroelements to the centromeres where they occupy long heterochromatic islands. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi and heterochromatin formation are independent genome defense and regulatory mechanisms in the Mucorales, contributing to a paradigm shift from the co-transcriptional gene silencing observed in fission yeasts to models in which heterochromatin and RNAi operate independently in early-diverging fungi.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2022.12.01.518749"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.04.519045", "title": "Performance of computational algorithms to deconvolve heterogeneous bulk tumor tissue depends on experimental factors", "authors": "Hippen, A.

In this study, we evaluate the importance of coding-sequence changes to the recent evolution of a novel anthocyanin pigmentation trait in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus. The magenta-flowered Mimulus luteus var. variegatus recently gained petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation via a single-locus Mendelian difference from its sister taxon, the yellow-flowered M. l. luteus. Mapping and functional tests previously showed that transcription factor MYB5a/NEGAN is the single gene responsible for this difference. We overexpressed the genomically encoded protein-coding sequences of MYB5a, from both M. l. luteus and M. l. variegatus, in Nicotiana tabacum leaves, in order to test their efficacy as anthocyanin-pigment activators. Quantitative image analysis of transfected tobacco leaves revealed robust anthocyanin production driven by both types of transgenes, compared to a negative control, and overall functional equivalency between the luteus and variegatus alleles. This finding supports the hypothesis that petal pigment was not gained by protein-coding changes in M. l. variegatus, but instead via non-coding cis-regulatory evolution.

Cab45 oligomerizes upon a local Ca2+ influx, and Cab45 oligomers sequester and separate soluble secretory cargo from the bulk flow of proteins in the TGN. However, how this Ca2+ flux into the lumen of the TGN is achieved remains elusive, as the cytosol has a very low steady-state Ca2+ concentration. The TGN forms membrane contact sites (MCS) with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), whereby the close apposition of the two organelles allows the protein-mediated exchange of molecular species such as lipids.

Developing methods to distinguish stem cells from other progenitors and evaluate stem cell functions has been a central task in stem cell research. Deep learning has been demonstrated as a powerful tool in cell image analysis and classification. In this study, we explored the possibility of using deep learning to differentiate HSCs and MPPs based on their light microscopy (DIC) images. After extensive training and validation with large image data sets, we successfully develop a three-class classifier (we named it the LSM model) that reliably differentiate long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and MPPs. Importantly, we demonstrated that our LSM model achieved its differentiating capability by learning the intrinsic morphological features from cell images. Furthermore, we showed that the performance of our LSM model was not affected by how these cells were identified and isolated, i.e., sorted by surface markers or intracellular GFP markers. Prospective identification of HSCs and MPPs in Evi1GFP transgenic mice by LSM model suggested that the cells with the highest GFP expression were LT-HSCs, and this prediction was substantiated later by a long-term competitive reconstitution assay. Moreover, based on DIC image data sets, we also successfully built another two-class classifier that can effectively distinguish aged HSCs from young HSCs, which both express the same surface markers but are functionally different. This finding is of particular interest since it may provide a novel quick and efficient approach, obviating the need for a time-consuming transplantation experiment, to evaluate the functional states of HSCs.

Molecular determinants distinguishing the trafficking of CHC22 clathrin from CHC17 within the GLUT4 pathway are defined in this study. The C-terminal trimerization domain of CHC22, but not CHC17, directly binds SNX5, which also binds the ERGIC tether p115. SNX5, and the functionally redundant SNX6, are required for CHC22 localization independently of their participation in the endosomal ESCPE-1 complex. Both the SNX5-BAR domain and an isoform-specific patch on the CHC22 N-terminal domain separately mediate binding to p115, and both interactions are required for CHC22 recruitment.

LLPS of UBQLN2 is driven by high salt concentration and reversed by the presence of Ub. However, the effects that these conditions have on the overall conformation of UBQLN2 remain unknown.

A dedicated tool for mitochondrial genome assembly using HiFi reads is still missing.\n\nResultsMitoHiFi was developed within the Darwin Tree of Life Project to assemble mitochondrial genomes from the HiFi reads generated for target species. The input for MitoHiFi is either the raw reads or the assembled contigs, and the tool outputs a mitochondrial genome sequence fasta file along with annotation of protein and RNA genes. Variants arising from heteroplasmy are assembled independently, and nuclear insertions of mitochondrial sequences are identified and not used in organellar genome assembly. MitoHiFi has been used to assemble 374 mitochondrial genomes (369 from 12 phyla and 39 orders of Metazoa and from 6 species of Fungi) for the Darwin Tree of Life Project, the Vertebrate Genomes Project and the Aquatic Symbiosis Genome Project. Inspection of 60 mitochondrial genomes assembled with MitoHiFi for species that already have reference sequences in public databases showed the widespread presence of previously unreported repeats.\n\nConclusionsMitoHiFi is able to assemble mitochondrial genomes from a wide phylogenetic range of taxa from Pacbio HiFi data.

Real-time monitoring of eGFP fluorescence lifetime showed that a faster response to environmental changes due to MMC is observed than when measuring the Y/C ratio using the MMC-sensitive GimRET sensor. This suggests that eGFP molecular electronic states and/or collision frequency are affected by changes in the immediate surroundings due to MMC without requiring conformational changes as is the case for the GimRET sensor. Furthermore, slower eGFP mobility and a lower anomalous diffusion parameter () are measured in cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress, indicating higher intracellular viscosity due to increased MMC.

During spindle checkpoint activation, checkpoint proteins bind the unattached kinetochore and send a diffusible signal to inhibit the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Previous work has shown that mitotic cells with depolymerized microtubules can escape prolonged spindle checkpoint activation in a process called mitotic slippage. During slippage, spindle checkpoint proteins bind unattached kinetochores, but the cells cannot maintain the checkpoint arrest. We asked if meiotic cells had as robust of a spindle checkpoint response as mitotic cells and whether they also undergo slippage after prolonged spindle checkpoint activity. We performed a direct comparison between mitotic and meiotic budding yeast cells that signal the spindle checkpoint due to a lack of either kinetochore-microtubule attachments or due to a loss of tension-bearing attachments. We find that the spindle checkpoint is not as robust in meiosis I or meiosis II compared to mitosis, overcoming a checkpoint arrest approximately 150 minutes earlier in meiosis. In addition, cells in meiosis I escape spindle checkpoint signaling using two mechanisms, silencing the checkpoint at the kinetochore and through slippage. We propose that meiotic cells undertake developmentally-regulated mechanisms to prevent persistent spindle checkpoint activity to ensure the production of gametes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMitosis and meiosis are the two major types of cell divisions. Mitosis gives rise to genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis is a reductional division that gives rise to gametes. Cell cycle checkpoints are highly regulated surveillance mechanisms that prevent cell cycle progression when circumstances are unfavorable. The spindle checkpoint promotes faithful chromosome segregation to safeguard against aneuploidy, in which cells have too many or too few chromosomes. The spindle checkpoint is activated at the kinetochore and then diffuses to inhibit cell cycle progression. Although the checkpoint is active in both mitosis and meiosis, most studies involving checkpoint regulation have been performed in mitosis. By activating the spindle checkpoint in both mitosis and meiosis in budding yeast, we show that cells in meiosis elicit a less persistent checkpoint signal compared to cells in mitosis. Further, we show that cells use distinct mechanisms to escape the checkpoint in mitosis and meiosis I. While cells in mitosis and meiosis II undergo anaphase onset while retaining checkpoint proteins at the kinetochore, cells in meiosis I prematurely lose checkpoint protein localization at the kinetochore. If the mechanism to remove the checkpoint components from the kinetochore is disrupted, meiosis I cells can still escape checkpoint activity. Together, these results highlight that cell cycle checkpoints are differentially regulated during meiosis to avoid long delays and to allow gametogenesis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522494"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.01.521342", "title": "Trafficking of nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins depends on F-actin and Myosin F in Toxoplasma gondii", "authors": "Devarakonda, P.

Perturbations affecting apicoplast function leads to parasite death. To maintain a functional apicoplast, the parasite must execute two important cellular processes: accurate division of this single copy organelle into daughter parasites during cell division and trafficking of nuclear encoded apicoplast proteins (NEAT). In this study we demonstrate that F-actin and an unconventional myosin motor, TgMyoF, are important for both processes. Live cell imaging demonstrates that during division the apicoplast is highly dynamic, exhibiting branched, U-shaped and linear morphologies that are dependent on TgMyoF and actin. These dynamics appear to control apicoplast association with the centrosome and positioning of the centrosome at the apicoplast tips. Loss of apicoplast dynamics correlated with reduced apicoplast-centrosome association and ultimately apicoplast inheritance defects. In addition, we uncovered the role of TgMyoF and actin in NEAT protein trafficking. Vesicles containing the apicoplast protein APT1 were only observed during apicoplast division in control parasites, however loss of TgMyoF and actin lead to accumulation of vesicles in the cytosol, with only a small impact on vesicle movement suggesting that this actomyosin system is important for vesicle fusion with the apicoplast. Consequently, loss of TgMyoF resulted in reduced apicoplast length.

Conversely, high shear stress (HSS) has atheroprotective effects on the endothelium. Endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles have been shown to regulate inflammation, senescence and angiogenesis and therefore play a crucial role in vascular homeostasis and disease. While previous studies have shown links between hemodynamic forces and extracellular vesicle release, the exact consequences of shear stress on the release and uptake of endothelial EVs remains elusive. Our aim is therefore to decipher the interplay between these processes in endothelial cells exposed to atheroprone or atheroprotective shear stress.\n\nConfluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to either LSS or HSS for 24 hours. Large and small EVs were isolated from conditioned medium by sequential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. They were characterized by TEM, Western blot analysis of EV markers, tunable resistive pulse sensing, flow cytometry and proteomics. Uptake experiments were performed using fluorescently-labeled EVs and differences between groups were assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.\n\nWe found that levels of large and small EVs in HUVEC conditioned media were fifty and five times higher in HSS than in LSS conditions, respectively. In vivo and in vitro uptake experiments revealed greater EV incorporation by cells exposed to LSS conditions compared to HSS. Additionally, endothelial LSS-EVs appeared to have a greater affinity for HUVECs than HSS-EVs or EVs derived from platelets, red blood cells, granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that LSS-EVs were enriched in adhesion proteins such as PECAM1, MCAM, which were involved in EV uptake by endothelial cells. LSS-EVs also carried mitochondrial material, which may be involved in elevating reactive oxygen species levels in recipient cells.\n\nThese findings suggest that endothelial shear stress has a significant impact during EV biogenesis and uptake.

Such enhancers are convened to the appropriate promoter of target genes for gene regulations even though the enhancers and the promoters are apart a few mega-base pairs away from each other. In addition to physical distance, nucleotide mutations in enhancers influence a partial group of the target genes. Those make it more complicated to reveal the paired relationship between enhancer and promoter of target genes. Recently, advanced computational approaches are employed to predict such interactions. One approach requires a large number of different high-throughput datasets to predict such interactions; however, in practical aspects, all datasets for tissues and conditions of interest are not available. Whereas the alternative approach requires only genome sequences for particular predictions, their predictions are insufficient for practical applications. We address those issues by developing the digital Hi-C assay with a transformer-algorithm basis. This assay allows us to create models from simple/small/limited sequence-based datasets only. We apply the trained models to be able to identify long-distance interactions of genomic loci and three-dimensional (3D) genomic architectures in any other tissue/cell datasets; additionally, we demonstrated the predictions of genomic contexts by analysing the prediction patterns around the target locus in the three following genomic-context problems: enhancer-promoter interactions (i.e., promoter-capture Hi-C), the CTCF-enriched regions, and TAD-boundary regions.

Free energy landscapes of Cl- moving out of the binding site and into bulk solution demonstrate that the inclusion of polarization results in stronger ion binding and a second metastable binding site in ClR. Simulations focused on this hydrophobic binding site also indicate longer binding durations and closer ion proximity when polarization is included. Furthermore, simulations reveal that Cl- within this binding site interacts with an adjacent loop to facilitate rebinding events that are not observed when polarization is neglected.

This outcome is ensured by temporally separating replicative helicase loading (G1 phase) and activation (S phase). In budding yeast, helicase loading is prevented outside of G1 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of three helicase-loading proteins: Cdc6, the Mcm2-7 helicase, and the origin recognition complex (ORC). CDK inhibition of Cdc6 and Mcm2-7 are well understood. Here we use single-molecule assays for multiple events during origin licensing to determine how CDK phosphorylation of ORC suppresses helicase loading. We find that phosphorylated ORC recruits a first Mcm2-7 to origins but prevents second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Phosphorylation of the Orc6, but not of the Orc2 subunit, increases the fraction of first Mcm2-7 recruitment events that are unsuccessful due to the rapid and simultaneous release of the helicase and its associated Cdt1 helicase-loading protein. Real-time monitoring of first Mcm2-7 ring closing reveals that either Orc2 or Orc6 phosphorylation prevents Mcm2-7 from stably encircling origin DNA. Consequently, we assessed formation of the MO complex, an intermediate that requires the closed-ring form of Mcm2-7. We found that ORC phosphorylation fully inhibits MO-complex formation and provide evidence that this event is required for stable closing of the first Mcm2-7. Our studies show that multiple steps of helicase loading are impacted by ORC phosphorylation and reveal that closing of the first Mcm2-7 ring is a two-step process started by Cdt1 release and completed by MO-complex formation.\n\nSignificance StatementEach time a eukaryotic cell divides (by mitosis) it must duplicate its chromosomal DNA exactly once to ensure that one full copy is passed to each resulting cell. Both under-replication or over-replication result in genome instability and disease or cell death. A key mechanism to prevent over-replication is the temporal separation of loading of the replicative DNA helicase at origins of replication and activation of these same helicases during the cell division cycle. Here we define the mechanism by which phosphorylation of the primary DNA binding protein involved in these events inhibits helicase loading. Our studies identify multiple steps of inhibition and provide new insights into the mechanism of helicase loading in the uninhibited condition.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2023.01.02.522488"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.02.522381", "title": "Mechanically induced topological transition of spectrin regulates its distribution in the mammalian cortex", "authors": "Ghisleni, A.; Bonilla-Quintana, M.; Crestani, M.; Fukuzawa, A.; Rangamani, P.; Gauthier, N.", "author_corresponding": "Andrea Ghisleni", "author_corresponding_institution": "IFOM, the AIRC Institute of Moleular Oncology", "date": "2023-01-02", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "The cell cortex is a dynamic assembly that ensures cell integrity during passive deformation or active response by adapting cytoskeleton topologies with poorly understood mechanisms.

The kinocilium plays important roles in hair bundle development and the mechanics of sensory detection. To understand more about kinocilial development and structure, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish hair cells looking for cilia-associated genes that have yet to be characterized in hair cells. Here, we focus on three such genes - ankef1a, odf3l2a, and saxo2 - because the human or mouse orthologs are either associated with sensorineural hearing loss or are located near uncharacterized deafness loci. We made transgenic fish that express fluorescently tagged versions of their proteins, demonstrating their localization to the kinocilia of zebrafish hair cells. Furthermore, we find that Ankef1a, Odf3l2a, and Saxo2 exhibit distinct localization patterns along the length of the kinocilium. Lastly, we report a novel overexpression phenotype for Saxo2. Overall, these results suggest that the hair cell kinocilium is regionalized along its proximal-distal axis and set the groundwork to understand the role of these kinocilial proteins in hair cell structure and function.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/02/2022.12.31.521896"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.02.522155", "title": "Early infection response of the first trimester human placenta at single-cell scale", "authors": "Hoo, R.; Ruiz-Morales, E.

The placenta is a transient tissue located at the interface between the mother and the fetus. Some pathogens can access the placental barrier resulting in pathological transmission from mother to fetus, which may have a profound impact on the health of the developing fetus. Limited tissue accessibility, critical differences between humans and mice, and, until recently, lack of proper in vitro models, have hampered our understanding of the early placental response to pathogens. Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to describe the placental primary defence mechanisms against three pathogens that are known to cause fetal and maternal complications during pregnancy - Plasmodium falciparum, Listeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii. We optimise ex vivo placental explants of the first-trimester human placenta and show that trophoblasts (the epithelial-like cells of the placenta), and Hofbauer cells (placental macrophages) orchestrate a coordinated inflammatory response after 24 hours of infection. We show that hormone biosynthesis and transport are downregulated in the trophoblasts, suggesting that protective responses are promoted at the expense of decreasing other critical functions of the placenta, such as the endocrine production and the nourishment of the fetus. In addition, we pinpoint pathogen-specific effects in some placental lineages, including a strong mitochondrial alteration in the Hofbauer cells in response to T. gondii. Finally, we identify adaptive strategies and validate nutrient acquisition employed by the P. falciparum during placental malaria infection.

Protein-peptide interaction surface areas are relatively small and shallow, and there are often overlapping specificities in families of peptide-binding domains. Therefore, dissecting selectivity determinants can be challenging. PDZ domains are an example of a peptide-binding domain located in several intracellular signaling and trafficking pathways, which form interactions critical for the regulation of receptor endocytic trafficking, tight junction formation, organization of supramolecular complexes in neurons, and other biological systems. These domains are also directly targeted by pathogens, and a hallmark of many oncogenic viral proteins is a PDZ-binding motif. However, amidst sequences that target PDZ domains, there is a wide spectrum in relative promiscuity. For example, the viral HPV16 E6 oncoprotein recognizes over double the number of PDZ domain-containing proteins as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the cell, despite similar PDZ targeting-sequences and identical motif residues. Here, we determine binding affinities for PDZ domains known to bind either HPV16 E6 alone or both CFTR and HPV16 E6, using peptides matching WT and hybrid sequences. We also use energy minimization to model PDZ-peptide complexes and use sequence analyses to investigate this difference. We find that while the majority of single mutations had a marginal effect on overall affinity, the additive effect on the free energy of binding accurately describes the selectivity observed.

Diatoms exhibit enormous taxonomic and genetic diversity, which often result in peculiar biochemical and biological traits. Transposable elements (TE) represent a substantial portion of diatom genomes and have been hypothesized to exert a relevant role in enriching genetic diversity and centrally contribute to genome evolution. Here, through long-read whole genome sequencing, we identified a novel Mutator-Like Element (MULE) in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and we report the direct observation of its mobilization within the course of one single laboratory experiment. Under selective conditions, this novel TE inactivated the uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) gene of P. tricornutum, one of the two only endogenous genetic loci currently targeted for selectable auxotrophy in functional genetics and genome editing applications.\n\nWe report the first, real-time observation of the mobilization of a transposon in diatoms that possesses novel peculiar features. These include the combined presence of a MULE transposase domain with Zinc finger, SWIM-type domains, and of a diatom-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase of the zinc finger UBR type, which indicate a novel mobilization mechanism. Our findings provide new elements for the understanding of the role of TEs in diatom genome evolution and in the enrichment of intraspecific genetic variability. Ultimately, this raises relevant concerns on the targeting of loci such as UMPS as selectable markers for functional genetics and biotechnological applications in diatoms.\n\nSignificance StatementWe identified a novel DNA transposon in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

Most GNI algorithms have been developed for microarray gene expression datasets and their application to RNA-seq data is relatively recent. As the characteristics of RNA-seq data are different from microarray data, it is an unanswered question what preprocessing methods for RNA-seq data should be applied prior to GNI to attain optimal performance, or what the required sample size for RNA-seq data is to obtain reliable GNI estimates.\n\nResultsWe ran 9144 analysis of 7 different RNA-seq datasets to evaluate 300 different preprocessing combinations that include data transformations, normalizations and association estimators. We found that there was no single best performing preprocessing combination but that there were several good ones. The performance varied widely over various datasets, which emphasized the importance of choosing an appropriate preprocessing configuration before GNI. Two preprocessing combinations appeared promising in general: First, Log-2 TPM (transcript per million) with Variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) association estimator. Second, raw RNA-seq count data with PCC. Along with these two, we also identified 18 other good preprocessing combinations. Any of these algorithms might perform best in different datasets. Therefore, the GNI performances of these approaches should be measured on any new dataset to select the best performing one for it. In terms of the required biological sample size of RNA-seq data, we found that between 30 to 85 samples were required to generate reliable GNI estimates.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides practical recommendations on default choices for data preprocessing prior to GNI analysis of RNA-seq data to obtain optimal performance results.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.02.522518"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.02.522492", "title": "DISCO+QR: Rooting Species Trees in the Presence of GDL and ILS", "authors": "Willson, J.; Tabatabaee, Y.; Liu, B.; Warnow, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tandy Warnow", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "date": "2023-01-03", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenes evolve under processes such as gene duplication and loss (GDL), so that gene family trees are multi-copy, as well as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS); both processes produce gene trees that differ from the species tree.

The fibrotic scar is produced by myofibroblasts that interact with macrophages. Fibrosis is a complex process involving thousands of factors, therefore, to better understand fibrosis and develop new therapeutic approaches, it is necessary to simplify and clarify the underlying concepts. Recently, we described a mathematical model for a macrophage-myofibroblast cell circuit, predicting two types of fibrosis - hot fibrosis with abundant macrophages and myofibroblasts, and cold fibrosis dominated by myofibroblasts alone. To test these concepts and intervention strategies in a medically relevant system, we use a widely studied in-vivo injury model for fibrosis, myocardial infarction (MI). We show that cold fibrosis is the final outcome of MI in both mice and pigs and demonstrate that fibrosis can shift toward healing in regenerative settings. MI begind with an increase of myofibroblasts and macrophages, followed by macrophage decline leading to persistent cold fibrosis (only myofibroblasts). During this process, fibroblasts, unlike macrophages, acquire distinct fate changes. Using mathematical modeling we predict that targeting of the autocrine signal for myofibroblast division could block cold fibrosis. We identify TIMP1 as an autocrine cardiac myofibroblast growth factor in-vitro. Treatment of adult mice after MI with anti-TIMP1 antibodies reduces fibrosis in-vivo.

The g-ratio is the gold standard measure of assessing myelin thickness and quality, and traditionally is determined from measurements done manually from EM images - a time-consuming endeavour with limited reproducibility. These measurements have also historically neglected the innermost uncompacted myelin sheath, known as the inner myelin tongue. Nonetheless, the inner tongue has been shown to be important for myelin growth and some studies have reported that certain conditions can elicit its enlargement. Ignoring this fact may bias the standard g-ratio analysis, whereas quantifying the uncompacted myelin has the potential to provide novel insights in the myelin field. In this regard, we have developed AimSeg, a bioimage analysis tool for axon, inner tongue and myelin segmentation. Aided by machine learning classifiers trained on tissue undergoing remyelination, AimSeg can be used either as an automated workflow or as a user-assisted segmentation tool. Validation results show good performance segmenting all three fibre components, with the assisted segmentation showing the potential for further improvement with minimal user intervention. This results in a considerable reduction in time for analysis compared with manual annotation. AimSeg could also be used to build larger, high quality ground truth datasets to train novel deep learning models. Implemented in Fiji, AimSeg can use machine learning classifiers trained in ilastik.

These functions are disturbed by demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this work we present AimSeg, a new tool based on artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning) to assess myelin growth on electron microscopy images. Whereas standard metrics and previous computational methods focus on quantifying compact myelin, AimSeg also quantifies the inner myelin tongue (uncompacted myelin). This structure has been largely overlooked despite the fact that it has an important role in the process of myelin growth (both during development and in the adult brain) and recent studies have reported morphological changes associated with some diseases. We report the performance of AimSeg, both as a fully automated approach and in an assisted segmentation workflow that enables the user to curate the results on-the-fly while reducing human intervention to the minimum. Therefore, AimSeg stands as a novel bioimage analysis tool that meets the challenges of assessing myelin growth by supporting both standard metrics for myelin evaluation and the quantification of the uncompacted myelin in different conditions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.02.522533"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.03.522478", "title": "Modulating membrane shape and mechanics of minimal cells by light: area increase, softening and interleaflet coupling of membrane models doped with azobenzene-lipid photoswitches", "authors": "Aleksanyan, M.; Grafmueller, A.; Crea, F.; Gergiev, V.

Here we used the mass spectrometry-based and light-controlled proximity labeling strategy LUX-MS in a discovery-driven manner to decode HDL-receptor interactions. Surfaceome nanoscale organization analysis of hepatocytes and endothelial cells using LUX-MS revealed that the previously known HDL-binding protein scavenger receptor SCRB1 is embedded in a cell surface protein community, which we term HDL synapse. Modulating the endothelial HDL synapse, composed of 60 proteins, by silencing individual members showed that the HDL synapse can be assembled in the absence of SCRB1 and that the members are interlinked. The aminopeptidase AMPN (also known as CD13) was identified as an HDL synapse member that directly influences HDL uptake into the primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Our data indicate that preformed cell surface residing protein complexes modulate HDL function and suggest new theragnostic opportunities.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.03.522574"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.01.522064", "title": "Investigation of the Impact of Clonal Hematopoiesis on Severity and Pathophysiology of COVID-19 in Rhesus Macaques", "authors": "Shin, T.-H.; Zhou, Y.; Lee, B.-C.; Hong, S.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells bearing acquired somatic mutations, is associated with advanced age and hyperinflammation. Given the similar age range and hyperinflammatory phenotype between frequent CH and severe COVID-19, CH could impact the risk of severe COVID-19. Human cohort studies have attempted to prove this relationship, but conclusions are conflicting. Rhesus macaques (RMs) are being utilized to test vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. However, RMs, even other species, have not yet been reported to develop late inflammatory COVID-19 disease. Here, RMs with either spontaneous DNMT3A or engineered TET2 CH along with similarly transplanted and conditioned controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored until 12 days post-inoculation (dpi). Although no significant differences in clinical symptoms and blood counts were noted, an aged animal with natural DNMT3A CH died on 10 dpi. CH macaques showed evidence of sustained local inflammatory responses compared to controls. Interestingly, viral loads in respiratory tracts were higher at every timepoint in the CH group.

In this study we analyze the behavior of dihedral (phi and psi) angles of the spike protein over time from molecular dynamics and identify that the oscillations of these dihedral angles are dominated by a few discrete, relatively low frequencies in the 23-63 MHz range with 42.96875 MHz being the most prevalent frequency sampled by the oscillations. We further observe that upon tallying the populations of each individual frequency for all residues along the frequency spectrum, there is a regular alternation between high and low population counts along the increasing frequency values in the spectrum. This alternation of the counts becomes less pronounced and ultimately stabilizes as the frequency values increase. These observations thus suggest a regularity and propensity in the spike proteins dihedral angles to avoid similar oscillation population counts between vicinal frequencies. We also observe that for amino acids that are least abundant in the S protein, there are certain frequencies at which the dihedral angles never oscillate, in contrast to relatively abundant amino acids that ultimately cover the entire spectrum. This suggests that the frequency components of dihedral angle oscillations may also be a function of position in the primary structure: the more positions an amino acid is found in, the more frequencies it can sample. Lastly, certain residues identified in the literature as constituting the inside of a druggable pocket of the spike protein, as well as other residues identified as allosteric sites, are observed in our data to have distinctive time domain profiles. This motivates us to propose residues from our dynamic data, with similar time domain profiles, which may be of potential interest to the vaccine and drug design communities, for further investigation.

Indeed, exacerbated activation of the gastrointestinal immune system toward the gut microbiota occurs in genetically susceptible hosts and under the influence of the environment.

However, the relative impacts of genotype versus microbiota on colitis susceptibility in the context of CARD9 deficiency remain unknown.\n\nResultsCard9 gene directly contributes to recovery from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by inducing the colonic expression of the cytokine IL-22 and the antimicrobial peptides Reg3{beta} and Reg3{gamma} independently of the microbiota. On the other hand, Card9 is required for regulating the microbiota capacity to produce AhR ligands, which leads to the production of IL-22 in the colon, promoting recovery after colitis.

Here, we propose ACIDES (Accurate Confidence Intervals to rank Directed Evolution Scores), a combination of statistical inference and in-silico simulations to: (i) reliably estimate the selectivity of individual variants and its statistical error using the data from all available rounds; (ii) identify which variants among the best ones are worth keeping for further tests; (iii) quantify if DE has converged onto the few variants with desired function or if additional experimental rounds/replicates or deep sequencing are needed. The latter point allows for integrating ACIDES into the experimental pipeline to avoid unnecessary, costly and time-consuming experimental efforts. To showcase our method we re-analyze public datasets ranging from DE of viral vectors to phage-display or yeast competitive growth experiments. Lastly, we benchmark our method against previously proposed approaches in the literature.\n\nSignificance StatementDirected evolution (DE) is a protein engineering strategy that mimics Darwinian evolution within laboratory environments. Using NGS (Next Generation Sequencing: massively paralleled assay of DNA sequencing), candidate proteins are monitored during DE experiments to understand the selection process and to identify the fittest proteins. However, the number of evolving proteins is often larger than the number of proteins that NGS measurements can read, leading to noisy signals. Here, in order to harness the noise, we develop an in-silico monitoring framework to account for the noise and estimate the performance of each variant with an accurate credibility score. Our method can be used on the fly during the experiments and will help DE experimentalists with decision making.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.03.522172"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.03.521284", "title": "The genetic architecture of the human skeletal form", "authors": "Kun, E.; Javan, E.

Phenotypic and polygenic risk score analyses identified specific associations between osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, and skeletal proportions of the corresponding regions. We also found genomic evidence of evolutionary change in arm-to-leg and hip-width proportions in humans consistent with striking anatomical changes in these skeletal proportions in the hominin fossil record.

Gene sets from recently sequenced accessions have different gene identifiers to those on the reference accession, and might be of higher quality due to technical advances. For these reasons there is a need to define pangenes, which represent all known syntenic orthologues for a gene model and can be linked back to the original sources. A pangene set effectively summarizes our current understanding of the coding potential of a crop and can be used to inform gene model annotation in new cultivars. Here we present an approach (get_pangenes) to identify and analyze pangenes that is not biased towards the reference annotation. The method involves computing Whole Genome Alignments (WGA), which are used to estimate gene model overlaps. After a benchmark on Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and barley datasets, we find that two different WGA algorithms (minimap2 and GSAlign) produce similar pangene sets. Our results show that pangenes recapitulate known phylogeny-based orthologies while adding extra core gene models in rice. More importantly, get_pangenes can also produce clusters of genome segments (gDNA) that overlap with gene models annotated in other cultivars. By lifting-over CDS sequences, gDNA clusters can help refine gene models across individuals and confirm or reject observed gene Presence-Absence Variation.

Using engineered cell lines, we express either isoform to define their mode of action, and develop an unbiased method to identify Svb target genes in intestinal cells.

We combined molecular modelling and functional assays to show that the regulatory module of aPKC{iota}, comprising the PB1 pseudo-substrate and C1 domains, forms a cooperative and spatially continuous invariant membrane interaction platform.

Thus, the ability to assign peptide sequences to the acquired tandem mass spectra without prior information--de novo peptide sequencing--is valuable for gaining biological insights for tasks including antibody sequencing, immunopeptidomics, and metaproteomics. Although many methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, it remains an outstanding challenge, in part due to the difficulty of modeling the irregular data structure of tandem mass spectra.

Yet, the symmetry breaking process in the membrane, that leads to dynamic compartmentalization of different proteins, remains poorly understood. Using multimodal live-cell imaging, here we first show that multiple endogenous and synthetic lipid-anchored proteins, despite maintaining stable tight association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, were unexpectedly depleted from the membrane domains where the signaling network was spontaneously activated such as in the new protrusions as well as within the propagating ventral waves. Although their asymmetric patterns resembled those of standard peripheral \"back\" proteins such as PTEN, unlike the latter, these lipidated proteins did not dissociate from the membrane upon global receptor activation. Our experiments not only discounted the possibility of recurrent reversible translocation from membrane to cytosol as it occurs for weakly bound peripheral membrane proteins, but also ruled out the necessity of directed vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal supramolecular structure-based restrictions in driving these dynamic symmetry breaking events. Selective photoconversion-based protein tracking assays suggested that these asymmetric patterns instead originate from the inherent ability of these membrane proteins to \"dynamically partition\" into distinct domains within the plane of the membrane. Consistently, single-molecule measurements showed that these lipid-anchored molecules have substantially dissimilar diffusion profiles in different regions of the membrane. When these profiles were incorporated into an excitable network-based stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the system, simulations revealed that our proposed \"dynamic partitioning\" mechanism is sufficient to give rise to familiar asymmetric propagating wave patterns. Moreover, we demonstrated that normally uniform integral and lipid-anchored membrane proteins in Dictyostelium and mammalian neutrophil cells can be induced to partition spatiotemporally to form polarized patterns, by optogenetically recruiting membrane domain-specific peptides to these proteins. Together, our results indicate \"dynamic partitioning\" as a new mechanism of plasma membrane organization, that can account for large-scale compartmentalization of a wide array of lipid-anchored and integral membrane proteins in different physiological processes.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/03/2023.01.03.522496"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.03.522656", "title": "Evidence for in vitro extensive proliferation of adult hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells", "authors": "Katsuda, T.; Li, J.; Merrell, A.

The physics-based methods are computationally intensive and often have to trade accuracy for computational cost. The possible limitations of current machine learning (ML) methods are ineffective data representation, network architectures, and limited training data. Here, we propose a novel approach called PIsToN (evaluating Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks) that aim to distinguish native-like protein complexes from decoys. Each protein interface is transformed into a collection of 2D images (interface maps), where each image corresponds to a geometric or biochemical property in which pixel intensity represents the feature values. Such a data representation provides atomic-level resolution of relevant protein characteristics. To build hybrid machine learning models, additional empirical-based energy terms are computed and provided as inputs to the neural network. The model is trained on thousands of native and computationally-predicted protein complexes that contain challenging examples. The multi-attention transformer network is also endowed with explainability by highlighting the specific features and binding sites that were the most important for the classification decision.

Catalytic sites with Sec in selenoproteins of vertebrates are under strong purifying selection but one enzyme, Glutathione Peroxidase 6 (GPX6), independently exchanged Sec for Cys less than one hundred million years ago in several mammalian lineages. We reconstructed and assayed these ancient enzymes before and after Sec was lost and up to today, and found them to have lost their classic ability to reduce hydroperoxides using glutathione (GSH). This loss of function, however, was accompanied by bursts of amino acid changes in the catalytic domain, with protein sites concertedly changing under positive selection across distant lineages abandoning Sec in GPX6. This demonstrates that when sulfur in Cys impairs catalysis a narrow evolutionary path is followed, with epistasis and pleiotropy leading to convergent evolution and triggering enzymatic properties likely beyond those in classic GPXs.

Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TD-EVs) are key players in this process. They can interact with immune cells and modulate their activity, either suppressing or activating the immune system. Understanding the interactions between TD-EVs and immune cells is essential for understanding immune modulation by cancer cells. Fluorescent labelling of TD-EVs is a method of choice to study such interaction. This work aims to determine the impact of EV labelling methods on the detection of EV interaction and capture by the different immune cell types within human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), analyzed by imaging flow cytometry and multicolor spectral flow cytometry. EVs released by the triple-negative breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 were labeled either with the lipophilic dye MemGlow-488 (MG-488), with Carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE), or through expression of a MyrPalm-superFolder GFP (sfGFP) that incorporates into EVs during their biogenesis using a genetically engineered cell line. Our results showed that these different labeling strategies, although analyzed with the same techniques, led to diverging results. While MG-488-labelled EVs incorporate in all cell types, CFSE-labelled EVs are restricted to a minor subset of cells and sfGFP-labelled EVs are mainly detected in CD14+ monocytes which are the main uptakers of EVs and other particles, regardless of the labeling method. Moreover, MG-488-labeled liposomes behaved similarly to MG-488 EVs, highlighting the predominant role of the labelling strategy on the visualization and analysis of TD-EVs uptake by immune cell types.

We applied these criteria to an archetypal ribonucleoprotein condensate and discovered that demixing into distinct protein-RNA condensates cannot be the result of purely thermodynamic considerations. Instead, demixed, compositionally distinct condensates arise due to asynchronies in timescales that emerge from differences in long-lived protein-RNA and RNA-RNA crosslinks.

Here, we evaluate both the theoretical basis and practical implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method is highly-conservative, and therefore, unlikely to mischaracterize reads as spliced (mature) or unspliced (nascent) when they are not. However, we find that it leaves a large fraction of reads classified as ambiguous, and, in practice, allocates these ambiguous reads in an all-or-nothing manner, and differently between single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Further, as implemented in practice, the ambiguous classification is implicit and based on the index against which the reads are mapped, which leads to several drawbacks compared to methods that consider both spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) mapping targets simultaneously -- for example, the ability to use confidently assigned reads to rescue ambiguous reads based on shared UMIs and gene targets. Nonetheless, we show that these conservative assignment rules can be obtained directly in existing approaches simply by altering the set of targets that are indexed. To this end, we introduce the spliceu reference and show that its use with alevin-fry recapitulates the more conservative proposed classification.\n\nWe also observe that, on experimental data, and under the proposed allocation rules for ambiguous UMIs, the difference between the proposed classification scheme and existing conventions appears much smaller than previously reported. We demonstrate the use of the new piscem index for mapping simultaneously against spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) targets, allowing classification against the full nascent and mature transcriptome in human or mouse in <3GB of memory.

Here, we introduce a MuLan-Methyl, a deep learning framework for predicting DNA methylation sites, which is based on multiple (five) popular transformer-based language models. The framework identifies methylation sites for three different types of DNA methylation, namely N6-adenine (6mA), N4-cytosine (4mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Each of the five employed language models is adapted to the task using the \"pre-train and fine-tune\" paradigm. Pre-training is performed on a custom corpus consisting of DNA fragments and taxonomy lineages using self-supervised learning. Fine-tuning then aims at predicting the DNA-methylation status of each type. The five models are used to collectively predict the DNA methylation status.

We examined the folding landscape of monomeric caspases from two coral species over a broad pH range of 3 to 10.5.

The B-repeat superdomain is responsible for intercellular adhesion that leads to the development of biofilms occurring in such infections. It was recently demonstrated that Zn-induced B-repeat assembly leads to formation of functional amyloid fibrils, which offer strength and stability to the biofilm. Rigorous biophysical studies of Aap B-repeats from S. epidermidis strain RP62A revealed Zn-induced assembly into a stable, reversible dimer and tetramer, prior to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Genetic manipulation is not tractable for many S. epidermidis strains, including RP62A; instead, many genetic studies have used strain 1457. Therefore, to better connect findings from biophysical and structural studies of B-repeats to in vivo studies, the B-repeat superdomain from strain 1457 was examined. Differences between the B-repeats from strain RP62A and 1457 include the number of B-repeats, which has been shown to play a critical role in assembly into amyloid fibrils, as well as the distribution of consensus and variant B-repeat subtypes, which differ in assembly competency and thermal stability. Detailed investigation of the Zn-induced assembly of the full B-repeat supderdomain from strain 1457 was conducted using analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas the previous construct from RP62A (Brpt5.5) formed a stable tetramer prior to aggregation, Brpt6.5 from 1457 forms extremely large stable species on the order of 28- and 32-mers, prior to aggregation into similar amyloid fibrils. Importantly, both assembly pathways proceed through the same mechanism of dimerization and tetramerization, and both conclude with the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. Theoretical discussions of the energy landscape of B-repeats from different strains and of different length are provided with considerations of biological implications.\n\nStatement of SignificanceStaphylococcus epidermidis is a major pathogen responsible for device-related infections. The primary factor responsible for such infections is the accumulation-associated protein, Aap, through its ability to mediate formation of dense surface-adherent communities of bacteria known as biofilms. Our lab recently demonstrated that the B-repeat superdomain of Aap from strain RP62A undergoes Zn-dependent assembly to form functional amyloid fibrils that improve the strength and resilience of biofilms in vitro. These amyloid fibrils may be responsible for the difficulty in treating device-related infections. However, strain 1457 is commonly used for genetic manipulation. In this manuscript, the Zn-dependent assembly of B-repeats from strain 1457 is shown to lead to the same outcome of amyloidogenesis, although it occurs through different intermediate oligomeric states.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2023.01.04.522776"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.04.522768", "title": "Wetting by biomolecular condensates increases membrane lipid packing and dehydration", "authors": "Mangiarotti, A.; Siri, M.; Zhao, Z.; Malacrida, L.; Dimova, R.", "author_corresponding": "Agustin Mangiarotti", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces", "date": "2023-01-04", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Membrane wetting by biomolecular condensates recently emerged as a critical phenomenon in cell biology, involved in a great diversity of processes across different organisms.

Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy and data analysis pipeline, named Simultaneous Proteome Localization and Turnover (SPLAT), to measure concurrently the changes in protein turnover and subcellular distribution in the same experiment. Investigating two common UPR models of thapsigargin and tunicamycin challenge, we find that the global suppression of protein synthesis during UPR is dependent on subcellular localization, with more severe slowdown in lysosome vs. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein turnover. Most candidate translocation events affect pre-existing proteins and likely involve vesicular transport across endomembrane fractions including an expansion of an ER-derived vesicle (ERV) compartment containing RNA binding proteins and stress response proteins. In parallel, we observed specific translocations involving only newly synthesized protein pools that are indicative of endomembrane stalling. The translocation of a subclass of cell surface proteins to the endomembrane including EGFR and ITGAV upon UPR affects only heavy labeled proteins, which suggest their internalization is driven by nascent protein trafficking rather than ligand dependent endocytosis.

Selective breeding using genomic selection has potential to achieve cumulative improvement of host resistance. However, genomic selection is expensive partly due to the cost of genotyping high numbers of animals using high-density SNP arrays. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of genomic selection for resistance to F. columnare using in silico low-density (LD) panels combined with imputation. After a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 2,874 challenged fish and 469 fish from the parental generation (n=81 parents) were genotyped with 27,907 SNPs. The efficiency of genomic prediction using LD-panels was assessed for panels of 10 different densities, created in silico using two sampling methods, random and equally spaced. All LD-panels were also imputed to the full 28K HD-panel using the parental generation as the reference population, and genomic predictions were reevaluated. The potential of prioritizing SNPs showing association with resistance to F. columnare was also tested for the six lower densities.\n\nResultsSimilar results were obtained with random and equally spaced sampling of SNPs for accuracy of both imputation and genomic predictions.

Tetracationic metallo-supramolecular pillarplexes display aryl faces about a cylindrical core giving them an ideal structure to interact with the central cavities of open DNA junctions. Combining experimental studies and MD simulations we show that an Au pillarplex can bind DNA 4-way junctions (Holliday junctions) in their open form, a binding mode not accessed by synthetic agents before. The Au pillarplexes can bind designed 3-way junctions too but their large size leads them to open up and expand that junction, disrupting the base pairing which manifests in an increase in hydrodynamic size and a lower junction thermal stability. At high loading they re-arrange both 4-way and 3-way junctions into Y-shaped DNA forks to increase the available junction-like binding sites. The structurally related Ag pillarplexes show similar DNA junction binding behaviour, but a lower solution stability. This pillarplex binding contrasts with (but complements) that of the metallo-supramolecular cylinders, which prefer 3-way junctions and we show can rearrange 4-way junctions into 3-way junction structures. The pillarplexes ability to bind open 4-way junctions creates exciting possibilities to modulate and switch such structures in biology, as well as in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures where they are key interconnecting components. Studies in human cells, confirm that the pillarplexes do reach the nucleus, with antiproliferative activity at levels similar to those of cisplatin. The findings provide a new roadmap for targeting higher order junction structures using a metallo-supramolecular approach, as well as expanding the toolbox available to design bioactive junction-binders into organometallic chemistry.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522759v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10fac36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f32f9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb8d72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1433de5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/04/2023.01.04.522759"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.04.522722", "title": "Generalized tree structure to annotate untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing data", "authors": "Li, S.; Zheng, S.", "author_corresponding": "Shuzhao Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine", "date": "2023-01-04", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "In untargeted metabolomics, multiple ions are often measured for each original metabolite, including isotopic forms and in-source modifications, such as adducts and fragments.

Here, we use a supported lipid bilayer platform in tandem with total internal reflection microscopy to observe the 2-dimensional movement of DNA and nucleosomes at the single-molecule resolution. This dimensional reduction from 3-dimensional studies allows us to observe the initial condensation events and dissolution of these early condensates in the presence of physiological condensing agents. Using polyamines, we observed that the initial condensation happens on a timescale of minutes while dissolution occurs within seconds upon charge inversion. Polyamine valency, DNA length and GC content affect threshold polyamine concentration for condensation. Protein-based nucleosome condensing agents, HP1 and Ki-67, have much lower threshold concentration for condensation than charge-based condensing agents, with Ki-67 being the most effective as low as 100 pM for nucleosome condensation. In addition, we did not observe condensate dissolution even at the highest concentrations of HP1 and Ki-67 tested. We also introduce a two-color imaging scheme where nucleosomes of high density labeled in one color is used to demarcate condensate boundaries and identical nucleosomes of another color at low density can be tracked relative to the boundaries after Ki-67 mediated condensation.

When reconstituted in vitro, these cytoskeletal proteins serve as energy-consuming building blocks to study the self-organization of active matter. Cytoskeletal active gels display rich emergent dynamics, including extensile chaotic flows, locally contractile asters, and bulk contraction. However, it is unclear which protein-scale interactions, if any, set the contractile or extensile nature of the active gel, or how to control the transition from one phase to another in a simple active system. Here, we explore the microscopic origin of the extensile-to-contractile transition in a reconstituted active material composed of stabilized microtubules, depletant, ATP, and clusters of kinesin-1 motors. We show that microscopic interactions between highly processive motor clusters and microtubules can trigger the end-accumulation of motor proteins, which in turn drives polarity sorting and aster formation. Combining experiments and simple scaling arguments, we demonstrate that the extensile-to-contractile transition is akin to a self-assembly process where nematic and polar aligning interactions compete. We identify a single control parameter given by the ratio of the different component concentrations that dictates the material-scale organization into either a contractile aster or an extensile bundle. Overall, this work shows that robust self-organization of cytoskeletal active materials can be controlled by precise biochemical and mechanical tuning at the microscopic level.\n\nSignificance statementSelf-organization in living cells is often driven by energy-consuming motor proteins that push and pull on a network of cytoskeletal filaments. However, it is unclear how to connect the emergent structure and dynamics of reconstituted cytoskeletal materials to the properties of their microscopic building blocks.

We combine experiments and scaling arguments to identify a single number that predicts if the system will self-assemble into bundles or asters.

Barring a few specific cases, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs remain poorly understood. Transcriptional proteins can form condensates via phase separation at protein-binding loci (BL) on the genome (e.g., enhancers and promoters). lncRNA-coding genes are present at loci in close genomic proximity of these BL and these RNAs can interact with transcriptional proteins via attractive heterotypic interactions mediated by their net charge. Motivated by these observations, we propose that lncRNAs can dynamically regulate transcription in cis via charge-based heterotypic interactions with transcriptional proteins in condensates. To study the consequences of this mechanism, we developed and studied a dynamical phase-field model. We find that proximal lncRNAs can promote condensate formation at the BL. Vicinally localized lncRNA can migrate to the BL to attract more protein because of favorable interaction free energies. However, increasing the distance beyond a threshold leads to a sharp decrease in protein recruitment to the BL. This finding could potentially explain why genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes and protein-coding genes are conserved across metazoans. Finally, our model predicts that lncRNA transcription can fine-tune transcription from neighboring condensate-controlled genes, repressing transcription from highly expressed genes and enhancing transcription of genes expressed at a low level. This non-equilibrium effect can reconcile conflicting reports that lncRNAs can enhance or repress transcription from proximal genes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCELong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form a significant part of the human genome but do not code for any proteins. They have many hypothesized functions in the cell, including the regulation of transcription. Transcriptional condensates are assemblies of transcriptional proteins that concentrate at specific genomic sites through phase separation and can regulate transcription. In this study, we propose that lncRNAs can regulate transcription by interacting with proteins in transcriptional condensates to modulate condensate formation. We find that this model can explain some puzzling observations such as conflicting reports of gene activation and repression by lncRNAs, and conservation of genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes relative to protein-coding genes in metazoans.

We examined the urea-induced equilibrium folding/unfolding of two initiator caspases, monomeric caspase-8 and cFLIPL, over a broad pH range.

Since phosphorylation is a key regulatory process in mitosis, we looked for specific mitotic phosphorylation of RAB6 using a phospho-proteomic approach. We found that RAB6 is phosphorylated at position S52 by the mitotic kinase Pololike kinase 1 (Plk1) in mitosis. Phosphorylated RAB6 localizes at the spindle poles from prophase to anaphase.

In order to look for mitotic roles of the Arp2/3 complex, here we use Drosophila neural stem cells as a model system. These cells are unusual in that they divide asymmetrically to produce a large and small daughter cell with different fates. Our analysis identifies a pool of Arp2/3-dependent actin-based membrane protrusions that form at the apical cortex of these cells as they enter mitosis. Strikingly, at metaphase, these protrusions co-localise with components of the SCAR complex. By perturbing Arp2/3 complex activity we show that this apical pool of actin likely functions to limit the accumulation of apical Myosin in metaphase. Following the onset of anaphase, the loss of these SCAR and Arp2/3 dependent structures then leads to a delay in the clearance of apical Myosin and to cortical instability at cytokinesis.

With these modified histones, we investigated their effects on the kinetics of transcription elongation by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) using single-molecule FRET. Pol II pauses at several locations within the nucleosome for a few seconds to minutes, which governs the overall transcription efficiency. We found that H2B ubiquitylations suppress pauses and shorten the pause durations near the nucleosome entry while H3K79me3 shortens the pause durations and increases the rate of RNA elongation near the center of the nucleosome. We also found that H2BK34ub facilitates partial rewrapping of the nucleosome upon Pol II passage. These observations suggest that H2B ubiquitylations promote transcription elongation and help maintain the chromatin structure by inducing and stabilizing nucleosome intermediates and that H3K79me3 facilitates Pol II progression possibly by destabilizing the local structure of the nucleosome.

DEAD-box protein Dhh1 has been implicated as an activator of decapping, in coupling codon non-optimality to enhanced degradation, and as a translational repressor, but its functions in cells are incompletely understood. RNA-Seq analyses coupled with CAGE sequencing of all capped mRNAs revealed increased abundance of hundreds of mRNAs in dcp2{Delta} cells that appears to result directly from impaired decapping rather than elevated transcription, which was confirmed by ChIP-Seq analysis of RNA Polymerase II occupancies genome-wide. Interestingly, only a subset of mRNAs requires Dhh1 for targeting by Dcp2, and also generally requires the other decapping activators Pat1, Lsm2, Edc3 or Scd6; whereas most of the remaining transcripts utilize NMD factors for Dcp2-mediated turnover. Neither inefficient translation initiation nor stalled elongation appears to be a major driver of Dhh1-enhanced mRNA degradation. Surprisingly, ribosome profiling revealed that dcp2{Delta} confers widespread changes in relative TEs that generally favor well-translated mRNAs. Because ribosome biogenesis is reduced while capped mRNA abundance is increased by dcp2{Delta}, we propose that an increased ratio of mRNA to ribosomes increases competition among mRNAs for limiting ribosomes to favor efficiently translated mRNAs in dcp2{Delta} cells. Interestingly, genes involved in respiration or utilization of alternative carbon or nitrogen sources are derepressed, and both mitochondrial function and cell filamentation (a strategy for nutrient foraging) are elevated by dcp2{Delta}, suggesting that mRNA decapping sculpts gene expression post-transcriptionally to fine-tune metabolic pathways and morphological transitions according to nutrient availability.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/05/2023.01.05.522830"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.05.522916", "title": "High-throughput single molecule tracking identifies drug interactions and cellular mechanisms", "authors": "McSwiggen, D.

Here we report the role of muropeptides derived from bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) in promoting mitochondrial functions in mammalian models. We found that muropeptides directly bind to ATP synthase, which stabilizes the complex and promotes its activity. The benefit is seen in increased oxidative respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as decreased oxidative stress in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Strikingly, we also found that muropeptide treatment can recover mitochondrial structure and functions, as well as inhibit several pathological phenotypes of mutant fibroblast cells derived from mitochondrial disease patients.

The mutant counts originating from some average number of mutations are usually assumed to obey the Luria-Delbruck distribution. While several tools for estimating mutation rates are available, they sometimes lack accuracy or versatility under non-standard conditions. In this work we developed extensions to the Luria- Delbruck protocol to account for phenotypic lag and cellular death with either perfect or partial plating. Hence, our novel MLE MUtation Rate calculator, or mlemur, is the first tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface allowing the researchers to model their data with consideration for partial plating, differential growth of mutants and non-mutants, phenotypic lag, cellular death, variability of the final number of cells, post-exponential-phase mutations, and the size of inoculum. Additionally, mlemur allows the users to incorporate most of these special conditions at the same time to obtain highly accurate estimates of mutation rates and p values, confidence intervals for an arbitrary function of data (such as fold) and perform power analysis and sample size determination for the likelihood ratio test. We assess the accuracy of point and interval estimates produced by mlemur against historical and simulated fluctuation experiments. We believe both mlemur and the analyses in this work might be of great help when evaluating fluctuation experiments and increase the awareness of the limitations of the widely-used Lea-Coulson formulation of the Luria-Delbruck distribution in the more realistic biological contexts.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite many recent developments in the department of fluctuation data analysis, geneticists are often limited to either a very strict classical Luria-Delbruck protocol, or possibly a modified one with relaxation of just one assumption (e.g., differential fitness of mutants and wild-type cells). In some cases, such as partial plating, researchers use historical methods whose accuracy strictly depends on the conditions of the experiment and thus are not optimal in a wide range of parameters. A novel tool for fluctuation data analysis, mlemur (MLE MUtation Rate calculator), alleviates these problems and provides new extensions that allow to account for phenotypic lag and cellular death. Additionally, we find that the failure to properly account for these additional parameters might lead to inaccurate point and interval estimates of the mutation rate. Our results underline the importance of careful examination of the fluctuation assay to ensure that the chosen statistical model reflects the biological and technical conditions of the experiment.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2023.01.05.522850"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.05.522844", "title": "Intermediate molecular phenotypes to identify genetic markers of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity risk", "authors": "Gomez-Vecino, A.; Corchado-Cobos, R.; Blanco-Gomez, A.; Garcia-Sancha, N.; Castillo-Lluva, S.; Martin-Garcia, A.; Prieto, C.; Ruiz-Pinto, S.; Pita, G.; Velasco-Ruiz, A.; Patino-Alonso, C.; Galindo-Villardon, M.

A genetically heterogeneous cohort of mice generated by backcrossing (N = 165) was treated with doxorubicin and docetaxel. Cardiac histopathological damage was measured by fibrosis and cardiomyocyte size by an Ariol slide scanner. We determine intramyocardial levels of intermediate molecular phenotypes of CDA associated with histopathological damage and quantitative trait loci (ipQTLs) linked to them. These ipQTLs seem to contribute to the missing heritability of CDA because they improve the heritability explained by QTL directly linked to CDA (cda-QTLs) through genetic models. Genes encoding these molecular subphenotypes were evaluated as genetic markers of CDA in three cancer patient cohorts (N = 517) whose cardiac damage was quantified by echocardiography or Cardiac Magnetic Resonance.

For small panels the probabilistic parameterization of LS enables modeling the uncertainties of such mosaics, and has been the foundational model for haplotype phasing and imputation. However, LS becomes inefficient when sample size is large (tens of thousands to millions), because of its linear time complexity (O(MN), where M is the number of haplotypes and N is the number of sites in the panel). Recently the PBWT, an efficient data structure capturing the local haplotype matching among haplotypes, was proposed to offer fast methods for giving some optimal solution (Viterbi) to the LS HMM. But the solution space of the LS for large panels is still elusive. Previously we introduced the Minimal Positional Substring Cover (MPSC) problem as an alternative formulation of LS whose objective is to cover a query haplotype by a minimum number of segments from haplotypes in a reference panel. The MPSC formulation allows the generation of a haplotype threading in time constant to sample size (O(N)). This allows haplotype threading on very large biobank scale panels on which the LS model is infeasible. Here we present new results on the solution space of the MPSC by first identifying a property that any MPSC will have a set of required regions, and then proposing a MPSC graph. In addition, we derived a number of optimal algorithms for MPSC, including solution enumerations, the Length Maximal MPSC, and h-MPSC solutions.

By taking advantages of stimulated Raman scattering in label-free, high-speed, and high-resolution chemical imaging, we firstly imaged 53951 exfoliated cells in ascites obtained from 80 GC patients (27 PM positive, 53 PM negative), at the Raman bands corresponding to DNA, protein, and lipid, respectively.

Such matrix was crucial to identify the significant marker cell cluster, the divergence of which was finally used to differentiate the PM positive and negative.

In this study, we investigated metabolic alterations of EC to understand the variations in the metabolism within tumor samples.\n\nMethodsWe integrated the TCGA transcriptomics data of EC (RNA-Seq) with the human genome-scale metabolic model (HMR2.0) and performed unsupervised learning to identify the metabolic subtypes of EC and uncover the underlying dysregulated metabolic pathways and reporter metabolites in each subtype. The relationship between metabolic subtypes and clinical variables was explored. Further, we characterized each subtype at the molecular level and correlated the subtype-specific metabolic changes occurring at the transcriptome level with the genomic alterations.\n\nResultsEC patients are stratified into two robust metabolic subtypes (cluster-1 and cluster-2) that significantly correlate to patient survival, tumor stages, mutation, and copy number variations. We observed coactivation of pentose phosphate pathway and one-carbon metabolism along with genes involved in controlling estrogen levels in cluster-2, which is linked to poor survival.

If degree strongly influences edge prediction, then imbalance or bias in the distribution of degrees could lead to nonspecific or misleading predictions. We introduce a network permutation framework to quantify the effects of node degree on edge prediction. Our framework decomposes performance into the proportions attributable to degree and the networks specific connections. We discover that performance attributable to factors other than degree is often only a small portion of overall performance. Degrees predictive performance diminishes when the networks used for training and testing--despite measuring the same biological relationships--were generated using distinct techniques and hence have large differences in degree distribution.

Fracture in response to physiological levels of stress can be undesired, for example resulting from disease or genetic mutations, or be an integral part of developmental processes, such as during blastocoel formation in mouse or during leg eversion in flies. Despite its importance, we know very little about fracture in cellularised tissues because it is a multi-scale process that necessitates comprehension of the interplay between mechanical forces and processes at the molecular and cellular scales. Using a combination of mechanical measurements, live imaging and computational modelling, we characterise fracture in epithelial monolayers. We show that, despite consisting of only a single layer of cells, monolayers can withstand surprisingly large deformations, often accommodating several-fold increases in their length before rupture. To protect against large deformation, epithelia increase their stiffness multiple-fold in a process controlled by keratin intermediate filaments. Perturbing keratin organisation fragilised monolayers and prevented strain stiffening. Using computational approaches, we show that, although the kinetics of bond rupture ultimately control fracture, tissue rheology and the history of deformation prior to failure set the strain and stress that the tissue reaches at the onset of fracture.

This increases the frequency of the drive in the population. All these drives, plus homing modification rescue drives, rely on having an effective rescue element, which consists of a recoded version of the target gene. This rescue element can be at the same site as the target gene, which maximizes the chance of efficient rescue, or at a distant site, which allows some other useful options, such as easily disrupting another essential gene or achieving greater confinement. Previously, we developed a homing rescue drive targeting a haplolethal gene and a toxin-antidote drive targeting an essential but haplosufficient gene. These successful drives had functional rescue elements but suboptimal drive efficiency. Here, we attempted to construct new toxin-antidote drives targeting these genes with a distantsite configuration from three different loci. We found that use of additional gRNAs increased cut rates to nearly 100%. However, all distant-site rescue elements failed for both haplolethal and haplosufficient target genes. Furthermore, one rescue element with a minimally recoded rescue element was used as a template for homology-directed repair for the target gene on a different chromosomal arm, resulting in the formation of functional resistance alleles at high frequency.

We instead aim to find a subspace with signal that is unique to a group of samples for which we believe that subphenotypic variation exists (e.g., cases of a disease). To that end, we introduce Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (PACA), a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. In the context of disease, PACA learns a gradient of variation unique to cases in a given dataset, while leveraging control samples for accounting for variation and imbalances of biological and technical confounders between cases and controls. We evaluated PACA using an extensive simulation study, as well as on various subtyping tasks using genotypes, transcriptomics, and DNA methylation data.

X-ray microcomputed tomography showed a higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and percentage of bone-implant contact (BIC) in the implants with 300 m pores than in the functionally-graded specimens, indicating that these smaller pore sizes may be favourable for osseointegration in leporine bone.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521963v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e319aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@baa9deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e66075org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c6c8c4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2023.01.05.521963"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.05.522919", "title": "Heterogeneous pseudobulk simulation enables realistic benchmarking of cell-type deconvolution methods", "authors": "Hu, M.; Chikina, M.", "author_corresponding": "Maria Chikina", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Pittsburgh", "date": "2023-01-18", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "Computational cell type deconvolution enables estimation of cell type abundance from bulk tissues and is important for understanding cell-cell interactions, especially in tumor tissues. With rapid development of deconvolution methods, many benchmarking studies have been published aiming for a comprehensive evaluation for these methods. Benchmarking studies rely on cell-type resolved single-cell RNA-seq data to create simulated pseudbulk datasets by adding individual cells-types in controlled proportions. In our work we show that the standard application of this approach, which uses randomly selected single cells, regardless of the intrinsic difference between them, generates synthetic bulk expression values that lack appropriate biological variance. We demonstrate why and how the current bulk simulation pipeline with random cells is unrealistic and propose a heterogeneous simulation strategy as a solution. Our heterogeneously simulated samples show realistic variance across hallmark gene-sets when comparing with real bulk samples from the TCGA dataset of the same tumor type. Using this new simulation pipeline to benchmark deconvolution methods we show that introducing biological heterogeneity has a notable effect on the results. Evaluating the robustness of different deconvolution approaches to heterogeneous simulation we find that reference-free methods that rely on simplex estimation perform poorly, marker-based methods and BayesPrism are most robust, while regress-based approaches fall in between. Importantly, we find that under the heterogeneous scenario marker based methods and BayesPrism outperform state of the art reference methods.

These mutations range in scale from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to large-scale copy-number aberrations (CNAs). While many approaches infer tumor phylogenies using SNVs as phylogenetic markers, CNAs that overlap SNVs may lead to erroneous phylogenetic inference. Specifically, an SNV may be lost in a cell due to a deletion of the genomic segment containing the SNV. Unfortunately, no current single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) technology produces accurate measurements of both SNVs and CNAs. For instance, recent targeted scDNA-seq technologies, such as Mission Bio Tapestri, measure SNVs with high fidelity in individual cells, but yield much less reliable measurements of CNAs. We introduce a new evolutionary model, the constrained k-Dollo model, that uses SNVs as phylogenetic markers and partial information about CNAs in the form of clustering of cells with similar copy-number profiles. This copy-number clustering constrains where loss of SNVs can occur in the phylogeny. We develop ConDoR (Constrained Dollo Reconstruction), an algorithm to infer tumor phylogenies from targeted scDNA-seq data using the constrained k-Dollo model. We show that ConDoR outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We use ConDoR to analyze a new multi-region targeted scDNA-seq dataset of 2153 cells from a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor and produce a more plausible phylogeny compared to existing methods that conforms to histological results for the tumor from a previous study.

Due to their complex life cycle involving both vertebrate and insect hosts, and > 1 billion years of evolutionarily distance, the cell biology of these trypanosomatid parasites exhibits pronounced differences to animal cells. For example, the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatids is highly divergent when compared to the other eukaryotes. To understand how actin dynamics are regulated in trypanosomatid parasites, we focused on a central actin-binding protein profilin. Co-crystal structure of Leishmania major actin in complex with L. major profilin revealed that, although the overall folds of actin and profilin are conserved in eukaryotes, Leishmania profilin contains a unique -helical insertion, which interacts with the target binding cleft of actin monomer. This insertion is conserved across the Trypanosomatidae family, and is strikingly similar to the structure of WH2 domain, a small actin-binding motif found in many other cytoskeletal regulators. We demonstrate that the WH2-like motif contributes to actin monomer-binding and enhances the actin nucleotide exchange activity of Leishmania profilin. Surprisingly, unlike other profilins characterized so far, Leishmania profilin inhibited formin-catalyzed actin filament assembly in a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of the WH2-like motif. By generating profilin knockout and knockin Leishmania mexicana strains, we show that profilin is important for efficient endocytic sorting in parasites, and that the ability to bind actin monomers and proline-rich proteins, as well as the presence of a functional WH2-like motif, are important for the in vivo function of Leishmania profilin. Collectively, this study uncovers the molecular principles by which actin dynamics are regulated by profilin in trypanosomatids. Moreover, the unusual actin-binding mechanism of profilin identified here could be applied for designing inhibitors against pathogenic trypanosomatid parasites.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLeishmania and Trypanosoma parasites are a major health problem as they cause various diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat the diseases caused by these trypanosomatid parasites. Similar to all other eukaryotes, trypanosomatid parasites have an actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the viability of parasites. Interestingly, both actin and actin-regulatory machineries of these parasites are highly divergent from the ones of animals, making them possible drug targets to treat diseases caused by these parasites. To uncover how the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatid parasites is regulated, we focused on a central actin-binding protein, profilin. Importantly, our experiments revealed that trypanosomatid profilins interact with actin through a different structural mechanism as compared to animal profilins, and have specific effects on the assembly of actin filaments. Our genetic studies demonstrate that these specific features of trypanosomatid profilin are also critical for the proper function on this protein in parasites. Our study provides new insight into the cell biology of trypanosomatid parasites. We also envision that the structural and functional differences between trypanosomatid and human profilins can be applied for developing compounds for selectively neutralizing Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/06/2023.01.06.522972"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.06.522997", "title": "Enhanced neuroimaging with a calcium sensor in the live adult Drosophila Melanogaster brain using closed-loop adaptive optics light-sheet microscopy", "authors": "Hubert, A.; Farkouh, G.; Harms, F.; Veilly, C.; Imperato, S.; Mercier, M.; Loriette, V.; Rouyer, F.; Fragola, A.", "author_corresponding": "Alexandra Fragola", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institut des Sciences Moleculaires d'Orsay, Universite Paris-Saclay, CNRS, 91400 Orsay, France", "date": "2023-01-06", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe report on an Adaptive Optics (AO) Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscope compatible with neuroimaging, based on direct wavefront sensing without the requirement of a guide star.

Herein, we show that inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with MS023 increases the proliferative capacity of ex vivo cultured MuSCs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ex vivo cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of novel subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically reprogrammed with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed more robustly to muscle regeneration following injury.

For this reason, an MDR strain of A. baumannii was subjected to MICs against 12 antibiotics as well as MP-B. Expression of the adeB gene in the presence and absence of sub-MIC of MP-B was studied by qRT-PCR.

Previously, we reported the first S. mutans negative selection system that functions in a wild-type background. This system utilizes induced sensitivity to the toxic amino acid analog p-chlorophenylalanine (4-CP) as a negative selection mechanism, and was developed for counterselection-based cloning-independent markerless mutagenesis (CIMM). While we have employed this system extensively for our ongoing genetic studies, we have encountered a couple limitations with the system, mainly its narrow host range and the requirement for selection on a toxic substrate. Here, we report the development of a new negative selection system that addresses both limitations, while still retaining the utility of the previous 4-CP-based markerless mutagenesis system. We placed a variety of toxin-encoding genes under the control of the xylose-inducible Xyl-S expression cassette and found the Fst-sm and ParE toxins to be suitable candidates for inducible negative selection. We combined the inducible toxins with an antibiotic resistance gene to create several different counterselection cassettes. The most broadly useful of these contained a wild-type fst-sm open reading frame transcriptionally fused to a point mutant form of the Xyl-S expression system, which we subsequently named as IFDC4. IFDC4 was shown to exhibit exceptionally low background resistance, with 3 - 4 log reductions in cell number observed when plating on xylose-supplemented media. IFDC4 also functioned similarly in multiple strains of S. mutans as well as with S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. We performed CIMM with IFDC4 and successfully engineered a variety of different types of markerless mutations in all three species. The counterselection strategy described here provides a template approach that should be adaptable for the creation of similar counterselection systems in many other bacteria.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.03.522674"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.06.522876", "title": "Surface frustration re-patterning underlies the structural landscape and evolvability of fungal orphan candidate effectors", "authors": "Derbyshire, M.

This stems, at least in part, from strong abilities to form biofilms on abiotic or biotic surfaces. Biofilms are well-organized multicellular aggregates of bacteria, which, when formed on indwelling medical devices, lead to infections that are difficult to treat. Cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins are known to be important players in biofilm formation and infection. Many of these proteins have putative stalk-like regions or regions of low complexity near the cell wall-anchoring motif. Recent work demonstrated the strong propensity of the stalk region of the S. epidermidis accumulation-associated protein (Aap) to remain highly extended under solution conditions that typically induce compaction or other significant conformational changes. This behavior is consistent with the expected function of a stalk-like region that is covalently attached to the cell wall peptidoglycan and projects the adhesive domains of Aap away from the cell surface. In this study, we evaluate whether the ability to resist compaction is a common theme among stalk regions from various staphylococcal CWA proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine secondary structure changes as a function of temperature and cosolvents along with sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS to characterize structural characteristics in solution. All stalk regions tested are intrinsically disordered, lacking secondary structure beyond random coil and polyproline type II helix, and they all sample highly extended conformations. Remarkably, the Ser-Asp dipeptide repeat region of SdrC exhibited nearly identical behavior in solution when compared to the Aap Pro/Gly-rich region, despite highly divergent sequence patterns, indicating conservation of function by various distinct staphylococcal CWA protein stalk regions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.06.523059"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.07.522792", "title": "Passive endocytosis in protocells enables nutrient transport bypassing permeability limits", "authors": "Zhang, S.

C. elegans development is characterized by five morphologically distinct stages, including four larval stages and the adult stage. Stages differ in a variety of aspects including size, gene expression, physiology, and behavior. Enrichment for a particular developmental stage is often the first step in experimental design. When many hundreds of worms are required, the standard methods of enrichment are to grow a synchronized population of hatchlings for a fixed time, or to sort a mixed population of worms according to size. Current size-sorting methods have higher throughput than synchronization and avoid its use of harsh chemicals. However, these size-sorting methods currently require expensive instrumentation or custom microfluidic devices, both of which are unavailable to the majority C. elegans laboratories. Accordingly, there is a need for inexpensive, accessible sorting strategies. We investigated the use of low-cost, commercially available cell strainers to filter C. elegans by size. We found that the probability of recovery after filtration as a function of body size for cell strainers of three different mesh sizes is well described by logistic functions. Application of these functions to predict filtration outcomes revealed non-ideal properties of filtration of worms by cell strainers that nevertheless enhanced filtration outcomes. Further, we found that serial filtration using a pair of strainers that have different mesh sizes can be used to enrich for particular larval stages with a purity close to that of synchronization, the most widely used enrichment method. Throughput of the cell strainer method, up to 14,000 worms per minute, greatly exceeds that of other enrichment methods.

Misrepresenting these relationships may lead to the erroneous prediction of e.g. disease spread, drug delivery, and nerve injury in the brain. However, understanding fluid-neuron interactions is an outstanding challenge because the behaviours of both phases are not only dynamic but also occur at an extremely small length scale (the width of flow channel is [~]100 nm), which cannot be captured by the state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Here, by explicitly simulating dynamics of the flow and axons at the microstructural level, we, for the first time, establish the link between micromechanical tissue response to the physical laws governing the macroscopic transport property of the brain white matter. We found that interactions between axons and the interstitial flow is very strong, thus playing an essential role in the brain fluid/mass transport. Furthermore, we proposed the first anisotropic pressure-dependent permeability tensor informed by microstructural dynamics for more accurate brain modelling at the macroscale, and analysed the effect of the variation of the microstructural parameters that influence such tensor. These findings will sheds light on some unsolved issues linked to brain functions and medical treatments relying on intracerebral transport, and the mathematical model provides a framework to more realistically model the brain and design the brain-tissue-like biomaterials.\n\nStatement of significanceThis study reveals how neurons interact with the fluid flowing around them and how these microscale interactions affect macroscale transport behaviour of the brain tissue. The findings provide unprecedented insights into some unsolved issues linked to brain functions and medical treatments relying on intracerebral fluid transport.

Standard-of-care shunts are synthetic, which can lead to thrombosis, and much stiffer than the two host vessels, which can cause adverse mechanobiological responses. Moreover, the neonatal vasculature can undergo significant changes in size and structure over a short period, thus constraining the use of a non-growing synthetic shunt.

Experimental panel assay protocols are routinely used as a standard procedure to evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of a drug candidate to target kinase. However, current kinase panel assays are time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the panel assay protocols neither provide insights on binding sites nor allow experiments on mutated sequences or newly-characterized kinases. Existing virtual screening or docking simulation technologies require extensive computational resources, thus it is not practical to use them for the panel of kinases. With rapid advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies, a number of DTI tools have been developed over the years. However, these methods are yet to achieve prediction accuracies at the level of practical use. In addition, the performances of current DTI tools vary significantly depending on test sets. In this case, an ensemble model can be used to improve and stabilize DTI prediction accuracies.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose an ensemble model, EnsDTI-kinase, that integrates eight existing machine learning and deep learning models into a unified model deployed as a web-server. Upon submission of a compound SMILES string, potential target kinases are automatically predicted and evaluated on the web-server. Importantly, EnsDTI-kinase is a computational platform where newly developed DTI tools can be easily incorporated without modifying core components so that its DTI prediction quality can improve over time. Besides, many useful functionalities are provided on our platform for users to further investigate predicted DTI: it allows confidence experiments by changing the amino acid (AA) at a specific position in a kinase sequence, named in silico mutagenesis, to investigate the effect of AA changes in binding affinity; it predicts kinase sequential regions where the query compound likely binds to by slidingly masking the sequence of selected kinases so that confidence in the predicted binding sites can be evaluated. Our model was evaluated in three experimental settings using four independent datasets, and showed accuracy of 0.82 compared to the average accuracy of 0.69 from five deep learning methods on the ChEMBL dataset. It achieved average selectivity of 0.95 within kinase families such as TK, CAMK and STE. For 8 out of 17 recent drugs, our model successfully predicted their interactions with 404 proteins at average accuracy of 0.82.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/ensdti\n\nContactsunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.06.523052"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.07.523113", "title": "Viral and bacterial ecogenomics in globally expanding red snow blooms", "authors": "Barno, A.

We hypothesize that the increased microbial densities affect virus-bacteria interactions in snow, with potential effects on snowmelt dynamics. A genomic analysis of viral and bacterial communities in red and white snow from the Whistler region of British Columbia, Canada, identified 792 putative viruses infecting bacteria. The most abundant putative snow viruses displayed low genomic similarity with known viruses. We recovered the complete circular genomes of nine putative viruses, two of which were classified as temperate. Genomes of putative snow viruses encoded genes involved in energy metabolisms, such as NAD+ synthesis and salvage pathways. In model phages, these genes facilitate increased viral particle production and lysis rates. Yet, the frequency of temperate phages was positively correlated with microbial abundance in the snow samples. These results suggest the increased significance of temperate virus-bacteria interactions as microbial densities increase during snowmelt.

However, the role of human-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in VSMC inflammation is poorly understood.\n\nMethodsBulk RNA-seq in differentiated human VSMCs revealed a novel human-specific lncRNA called INflammatory MKL1 Interacting Long Noncoding RNA (INKILN). INKILN expression was assessed in multiple in vitro and ex vivo models of VSMC phenotypic modulation and human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) samples. The transcriptional regulation of INKILN was determined through luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Both loss- and gain-of-function approaches and multiple RNA-protein and protein-protein interaction assays were utilized to uncover the role of INKILN in VSMC proinflammatory gene program and underlying mechanisms. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) transgenic (Tg) mice were utilized to study INKLIN expression and function in ligation injury-induced neointimal formation.\n\nResultsINKILN expression is downregulated in contractile VSMCs and induced by human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. INKILN is transcriptionally activated by the p65 pathway, partially through a predicted NF-{kappa}B site within its proximal promoter. INKILN activates the proinflammatory gene expression in cultured human VSMCs and ex vivo cultured vessels. Mechanistically, INKILN physically interacts with and stabilizes MKL1, a key activator of VSMC inflammation through the p65/NF-{kappa}B pathway. INKILN depletion blocks ILI{beta}-induced nuclear localization of both p65 and MKL1. Knockdown of INKILN abolishes the physical interaction between p65 and MKL1, and the luciferase activity of an NF-{kappa}B reporter. Further, INKILN knockdown enhances MKL1 ubiquitination, likely through the reduced physical interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP10. INKILN is induced in injured carotid arteries and exacerbates ligation injury-induced neointimal formation in BAC Tg mice.\n\nConclusionsThese findings elucidate an important pathway of VSMC inflammation involving an INKILN/MKL1/USP10 regulatory axis.

While specific proteins that localize to the distal appendages have been identified, how exactly each protein functions to achieve the multiple roles of the distal appendages is poorly understood. Here we comprehensively analyze known and newly discovered distal appendage proteins (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2, FBF1, CEP89, KIZ, ANKRD26, PIDD1, LRRC45, NCS1, C3ORF14) for their precise localization, order of recruitment, and their roles in each step of cilia formation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we show that the order of the recruitment of the distal appendage proteins is highly interconnected and a more complex hierarchy. Our analysis highlights two protein modules, CEP83-SCLT1 and CEP164-TTBK2, as critical for structural assembly of distal appendages. Functional assay revealed that CEP89 selectively functions in RAB34+ ciliary vesicle recruitment, while deletion of the integral components, CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2, severely compromised all four steps of cilium formation.

In an accompanying paper, we show that the distal appendage protein, CEP89, is important for thef ciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other steps of cilium formation (Tomoharu Kanie, Love, Fisher, Gustavsson, & Jackson, 2023). The lack of a membrane binding motif in CEP89 suggests that it may indirectly recruit ciliary vesicles via another binding partner. Here, we identify Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. NCS1 localizes to the position between CEP89 and a ciliary vesicle marker, RAB34, at the distal appendage. This localization was completely abolished in CEP89 knockouts, suggesting that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. Similarly to CEP89 knockouts, ciliary vesicle recruitment as well as subsequent cilium formation was perturbed in NCS1 knockout cells. The ability of NCS1 to recruit the ciliary vesicle is dependent on its myristoylation motif and NCS1 knockout cells expressing myristoylation defective mutant failed to rescue the vesicle recruitment defect despite localizing proper localization to the centriole.

Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated its effects on bone tissue, which were also notably predicted in the mechanostat theory. Indeed, existing methods to quantify bone mechanoregulation have successfully associated the frequency of remodeling events with local mechanical signals, combining time-lapsed in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging and micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis. However, a correlation between the local surface velocity of remodeling events and mechanical signals has not been shown. As many degenerative bone diseases have also been linked to impaired bone remodeling, this relationship could provide an advantage in detecting the effects of such conditions and advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel method to estimate remodeling velocity (RmV) curves from time-lapsed in vivo mouse caudal vertebrae data under static and cyclic mechanical loading. These curves can be fitted with piecewise linear functions as proposed in the mechanostat theory. Accordingly, new remodeling parameters can be derived from such data, including formation saturation levels (FSL), resorption velocity modulus (RVM), and remodeling thresholds (RmT). Our results revealed that the norm of the gradient of strain energy density ({nabla}SED) yielded the highest accuracy to quantify mechanoregulation data using micro-FE analysis with homogeneous material properties, while effective strain was the best predictor for micro-FE analysis with heterogeneous material properties. Furthermore, RmV curves could be accurately described with piecewise linear and hyperbola functions (root mean square error below 0.2 m/day for weekly analysis) and several remodeling parameters determined from these curves followed a logarithmic relationship with loading frequency, especially FSL and RmT values for both weekly and four-weekly analysis. Crucially, RmV curves and derived parameters could detect differences in mechanically driven bone adaptation, which complemented previous results showing a logarithmic relationship between loading frequency and net change in bone volume fraction over four weeks.

Integrated with an intracellular fluorescent assay, an on-chip detection limit of 1.8x106 CFU/mL is achieved for ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is similar to our off-chip results. We also develop a computer vision method to automatically distinguish positive and negative samples on the chip, showing 100% accuracy.

Thus, accurate computational modeling of PAM recognition is useful in assisting CRISPR-Cas engineering to relax or tighten PAM requirement for subsequence applications. Here we describe a universal computational protein design framework (UniDesign) for designing protein-nucleic acid interactions. As a proof of concept, we applied UniDesign to decode the PAM-PIAA interactions for eight Cas9 proteins. We show that, given native PIAAs, the UniDesign-predicted PAMs are largely identical to the natural PAMs of all Cas9s. In turn, given natural PAMs, the computationally redesigned PIAA residues largely recapitulated the native PIAAs (>70% and >80% in terms of identity and similarity, respectively). These results demonstrate that UniDesign faithfully captures the mutual preference between natural PAMs and native PIAAs, suggesting it as a useful tool for engineering CRISPR-Cas and other nucleic acid-interacting proteins.

Most unsupervised peak calling methods are based on simple statistical models and suffer from elevated false positive rates. Newly developed supervised deep learning methods can be successful, but they rely on high quality labeled data for training, which can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, though biological replicates are recognized to be important, there are no established approaches for using replicates in the deep learning tools, and the approaches available for traditional methods either cannot be applied to ATAC-seq, where control samples may be unavailable, or are post-hoc and do not capitalize on potentially complex, but reproducible signal in the read enrichment data.

During the reconstruction of Boolean DGRNs, even if the network structure is given, there is generally a very large number of combinations of Boolean functions (BFs) that will reproduce the different cell fates (biological attractors). Here we leverage the developmental landscape to enable model selection on such ensembles using the relative stability of the attractors. First we show that 5 previously proposed measures of relative stability are strongly correlated and we stress the usefulness of the one that captures best the cell state transitions via the mean first passage time (MFPT) as it also allows the construction of a cellular lineage tree. A property of great computational convenience is the relative insensitivity of the different measures to changes in noise intensities. That allows us to use stochastic approaches to estimate the MFPT and thus to scale up the computations to large networks. Given this methodology, we study the landscape of 3 Boolean models of Arabidopsis thaliana root development and find that the latest one (a 2020 model) does not respect the biologically expected hierarchy of cell states based on their relative stabilities. Therefore we developed an iterative greedy algorithm that searches for models which satisfy the expected hierarchy of cell states. By applying our algorithm to the 2020 model, we find many Boolean models that do satisfy the expected hierarchy.

In this study, we provide substantial evidence that DiPRO1 plays a role in human myoblast differentiation. It acts on regulatory binding regions of SIX1, which is a master regulator of myogenesis. We further describe the relevance of DiPRO1 in mesenchymal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing sarcoma. DiPRO1 plays a repressor role in these tumors via the epigenetic regulators TIF1B and UHRF1 in order to maintain methylation of regulatory cis-elements and promoters. Loss of DiPRO1 eradicates cancer cells, by switching on a distinct transcriptional and epigenetic program. It consists of mimicking the host defense against the virus response by awakening the retrotransposable repeats (RE) and the ZNP/KZFP gene family. DiPRO1 also contributes to the balance of cellular decisions toward inflammation and/or apoptosis by controlling TNF- via NF-kappaB signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that mesenchymal cancer tumors are vulnerable in response to si/shDiPRO1-based nanomedicines, positioning DiPRO1 as a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSummary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523169v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146f1e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3265borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b52fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@654f6d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523169"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523174", "title": "An oviduct glycan increases sperm lifespan by diminishing ubiquinone and production of reactive oxygen species", "authors": "Hughes, J.; McMorrow, K.; Bovin, N.; Miller, D.", "author_corresponding": "David Miller", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Sperm storage by females after mating for species-dependent periods is used widely among animals with internal fertilization to allow asynchrony between mating and ovulation.

Fibrosis is associated with the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which transdifferentiate into a myofibroblast like phenotype that is contractile, proliferative and profibrogenic. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, is elevated during HSC activation and promotes the expression of profibrotic mediator HIF target genes. HIF activation during HSC activation can by either due to localised decreases in oxygen levels, or through oxygen-independent mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here we describe a role for the deubiquitinase UCHL1 in regulating HIF levels and activity during HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Increased HIF1 expression correlated with induction of UCHL1 mRNA and protein with HSC activation. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of UCHL1 impaired HIF activity through reduction of HIF1 levels. UCHL1 specifically cleaves the degradative ubiquitin chains from HIF1 leading to increased HIF1 levels, even in sufficiently oxygenated cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies have shown that UCHL1 elevates HIF activity through specific cleavage of degradative ubiquitin chains, elevates levels of pro-fibrotic gene expression and increases proliferation rates. These results demonstrate how small molecule inhibitors of DUBs can modulate the activity of HIF transcription factors in liver disease. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF activity via modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway may represent a therapeutic opportunity with other HIF-related pathologies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523142v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d82ee9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eff21aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ffb0eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b93dc9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523142"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523144", "title": "Allele mining of eukaryotic translation initiation factor genes in Prunus species for the identification of new sources of resistance to sharka", "authors": "Tricon, D.; Faivre-DARCIER, J.; Eyquard, J.-P.; Liu, S.; Decroocq, S.; Chague, A.; Liu, W.; Balakishiyeva, G.; Mamadov, A.; Turdiev, T.; Kostritsyna, T.; Asma, B.; Akparov, Z.; DECROOCQ, V.", "author_corresponding": "Veronique DECROOCQ", "author_corresponding_institution": "INRAE UMR 1332 BFP Virologie", "date": "2023-01-08", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "BackgroundMembers of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex are co-opted in viral infection, leading to susceptibility in many crop species, including stone fruit trees (Prunus spp).

Integrating SRT data across multiple slices can help recover this information and improve downstream expression analyses, but multi-slice alignment and integration remains a challenging task. Existing methods for integrating SRT data either do not use spatial information or assume that the morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an assumption that is often violated due to biological or technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a method for partial alignment and 3D reconstruction of multi-slice SRT datasets, allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or slice-specific cell types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq dataset. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multi-slice datasets from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of spatial gene expression across a wide range of biological applications.\n\nCode availabilitySoftware is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/paste2", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.523162"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.522971", "title": "Epileptic seizure suppression: a computational approach for identification and control using real data", "authors": "Ferres Brogin, J.

Current development on this field has focused on obtaining computational models to better understand its triggering mechanisms, attain realistic descriptions and study seizure suppression. Controllers have been successfully applied to mitigate epileptiform activity in dynamic models written in state-space notation, whose applicability is, however, restricted to signatures that are accurately described by them. Alternatively, autoregressive modeling (AR), a typical data-driven tool related to system identification (SI), can be directly applied to signals to generate more realistic models, and since it is inherently convertible into state-space, it can thus be used for the artificial reconstruction and attenuation of seizures as well. Considering this, the first objective of this work is to propose an SI approach using AR models to describe real epileptiform activity. The second objective is to provide a strategy for reconstructing and mitigating such activity artificially, considering non-hybrid and hybrid controllers - designed from ictal and interictal events, respectively. The results show that AR models of relatively low order represent epileptiform activities fairly well and both controllers are effective in attenuating the undesired activity while simultaneously driving the signal to an interictal stage. These findings may lead to customized models based on each signal, brain region or patient, from which it is possible to better define shape, frequency and duration of external stimuli that are necessary to attenuate seizures.\n\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is perhaps one of the most studied brain disorders and it is still not sufficiently well understood. The use of computational models is useful in this case since several simulations can be run using them, such that experience and insight about seizures can be gained without necessarily carrying out experiments. These models are usually designed with or without some knowledge about the brain region or phenomenon. Seizure attenuation approaches have been proposed for the first case, but they are limited to the type of seizure correctly described by the model. The present work proposes a similar procedure for the second one (where only the data are available and nothing else is assumed), which is regarded as more realistic due to its direct application on the signals and can lead to customized models for each activity, brain region or patient, defining important information such as the shape, frequency and duration of the external stimuli that must be applied to mitigate a seizure.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/08/2023.01.08.522971"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.08.523183", "title": "Engineering Escherichia coli to produce aromatic chemicals from ethylene glycol", "authors": "Panda, S.; Zhou, J.

EG could be obtained from the degradation of plastic and cellulosic wastes. As a proof of concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to transform EG into L-tyrosine, a valuable aromatic amino acid. Under the best fermentation condition, the strain produced 2 g/L L-tyrosine from 10 g/L EG at approximately 50% of the theoretical yield, outperforming glucose (the most common sugar feedstock) in the same experimental conditions.

Finally, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were degraded using acid hydrolysis and the resulting monomer EG was transformed into L-tyrosine using the engineered E. coli, yielding a comparable titer to that obtained using commercial EG.

We generated a new intergeneric somatic hybrid and re-analyzed the two Solanaceae somatic hybrids. We inferred 213 homologous recombination events across repeats of 2.1 kb on average.

Interestingly, independent events frequently occurred in the same regions within and across somatic hybrids, suggesting the existence of recombination hotspots in plant mitogenomes. BIR is the main pathway of interparental recombination in somatic hybrid mitochondria.

Although much efforts at biochemical and genetic analyses have been made on the mechanism of GlnR-dependent transcription activation, it still remains unclear owing to lacking the structure of GlnR-dependent transcription activation complex (GlnR-TAC). Here, we report a crystal structure of a binary complex including a C terminal DNA binding domain of GlnR (GlnR_DBD) and its regulatory cis-element DNA, and a cryo-EM structure of GlnR-TAC comprising of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase, GlnR, and a promoter containing four well-characterized conserved GlnR binding sites. These structures show four GlnR protomers coordinately engage promoter DNA in a head-to-tail manner, with two N-terminal receiver domains of GlnR (GlnR-RECs) jointly act as a bridge to connect RNAP NTD with the upstream GlnR_DBD. GlnR-TAC is stabilized by complex protein-protein interactions between GlnR and the conserved {beta} flap, {sigma}AR4, CTD, NTD domains of RNAP. These are in good agreement with our mutational and kinetic single-molecule fluorescence assays. Altogether, our results reveal a general transcription activation mechanism for the global regulator GlnR and other OmpR/PhoB subfamily proteins, and present a unique mode of bacterial transcription regulation.\n\nSignificance statementIn low-GC gram-negative bacteria, the typical two component system NtrB/NtrC accounts for the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism. In high-GC gram-positive actinobacteria, GlnR, an atypical and orphan response regulator (RR) of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily proteins, globally coordinates transcription of genes involved in nitrogen, carbon and phosphate metabolism. Here, using crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we show that GlnR activates transcription by contacting DNA between the -10 and -35 elements and further upstream through contacting {sigma} region 4 and RNAP {beta} flap subunit.

The histone-reading function of ENL has been proven essential in the onset and progression of several acute leukemias, suggesting a putative therapeutic window for ENL inhibition.

This paper demonstrates that resistive-pulse measurements using polymer-coated solid-state nanopores enable label-free characterization of Synuclein oligomers with single-particle resolution. This approach determines the size and shape of individual oligomers in solution and it interrogates hundreds of particles within minutes. A comparison of the resulting size distribution with single-particle analysis by transmission electron microscopy and mass photometry reveals good agreement and superior resolution. In addition, nanopore-based analysis is attractive due to its unique capability to combine rapid size analysis with an approximation of oligomer shape. Applying this shape approximation to putatively toxic oligomeric species that range in concentration from picomolar to nanomolar and in size from 11-25 mer (10S) and 19-39 mer (15S), revealed shapes that agree well with previous estimates by cryo-EM with the advantage that nanopore-based analysis occurs rapidly, in solution, and has the potential to become a widely accessible analysis technique.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/09/2023.01.09.523202"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523295", "title": "A Multiscale Protein Abundance Structured Population Kinetic Model Systematically Explores the Design Space of Constitutive and Inducible CAR-T cells", "authors": "Das, J.; Rajakaruna, H.; Desai, M.", "author_corresponding": "Jayajit Das", "author_corresponding_institution": "The Research Institute at the Nationwide Childrens Hospital and the Ohio State University", "date": "2023-01-09", "category": "systems biology", "abstract": "Engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells are designed to bind to antigens overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells and induce tumor cell lysis.

Then DACT3 was identified as playing a critical role in AML, and its clinical significance was further explored. The molecular mechanism of DACT3 down-regulation in AML from aspects of DNA methylation and histone acetylation were inquired. Finally, the biological functions of DACT3 in AML were investigated by cell models in vitro and animal experiments in vivo.\n\nResultsCompared with DACT1 and DACT2, DACT3 was the most differentially expressed DACT family member in AML, suggesting that DACT3 plays the major role. The mRNA and protein expression levels of DACT3 were significantly decreased and positively correlated in AML. Moreover, low expression of DACT3 is associated with no remission disease status and poor prognosis in AML patients. In addition, down-regulation of DACT3 in AML was not completely dependent on promoter methylation, but also affected by histone deacetylation. We found that loss of DACT3 in AML is related to activation of Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, DACT3 inhibits the growth of AML cells in vitro and in severe immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Importantly, DACT3 improved the sensitivity of adriamycin in treating AML cells. Further research showed that co-treatment of chidamide and azacytidine up-regulates DACT3 expression and promotes cell apoptosis via inhibiting Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in AML, suggesting a promising therapeutic prospects in FLT3-mutant AML.\n\nConclusionThis is the first study revealing the epigenetic regulatory molecular mechanism of the down regulated expression of DACT3 in AML.

While the parasite lacks canonical DNA sequence specific transcription factors, it does possess histones, histone modifications, and proteins that write, erase, and read histone marks. Chemical inhibition of chromatin interacting bromodomain proteins has previously been shown to perturb bloodstream specific trypanosome processes, including silencing of the Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes (VSGs) and immune evasion. Transcriptomic changes that occur in bromodomain inhibited bloodstream parasites mirror many of the changes that occur as parasites developmentally progress from the bloodstream to the insect stage. We performed RNA-seq timecourses to determine the effects of chemical bromodomain inhibition in insect stage parasites using the compound I-BET151. We found that treatment with I-BET151 causes large changes in the transcriptome of insect stage parasites, and also perturbs silencing of VSG genes. The transcriptomes of bromodomain inhibited parasites share some features with early metacyclic stage parasites in the fly salivary gland, implicating bromodomain proteins as important for regulating transcript levels for developmentally relevant genes. However, the downregulation of surface procyclin protein that typically accompanies developmental progression is absent in bromodomain inhibited insect stage parasites. We conclude that chemical modulation of bromodomain proteins causes widespread transcriptomic changes in multiple trypanosome life cycle stages.

Long reads that can span repeat regions, along with an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in identifying novel SVs. Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can address this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates, making accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore sequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and proper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in designing a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this paper, we design and evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced reads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads along with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs (ii) incorporating SV specific changes to the alignment pipeline (iii) adapting these into existing state-of-the-art long read aligner pipeline, minimap2 (v2.24), for efficient alignments.\n\nResultsWe show that HQAlign captures about 4 - 6% complementary SVs across different datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a standalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data.

Here we show that reducing cholesterol in macrophages by statins upregulates JMJD3, a H3K27me3 demethylase. We provide evidence that this upregulation involves altered mitochondrial function, particularly the ATP synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). ATP synthase is suppressed by statin due to reduced cholesterol levels in IMM. This promotes JMJD3 expression. We also demonstrate that reducing cholesterol in macrophages alters the epigenetic configuration or epigenome. When macrophages are classically activated (M1), statin treatment suppresses the pro-inflammatory phenotype while enhancing anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression. On the other hand, when macrophages are alternatively activated (M2), statins promote the expression of Arg1, Ym1, and Mrc1. The enhanced expression of these anti-inflammatory factors correlates with H3K27me3 removal by statins in resting macrophages prior to activation. Lastly, we provide evidence that JMJD3 demethylase activity is necessary for cholesterol to modulate M1 and M2 activation in macrophages. We conclude that upregulation of JMJD3 in macrophages plays a key role in the anti-inflammatory effects of statins.\n\nSignificance StatementIn addition to lowering the plasma LDL, statins exert a well-documented anti-inflammatory effect clinically, though the mechanism is unknown. We show here that, by decreasing cellular cholesterol content, statins reduce cholesterol in the IMM to upregulates JMJD3, which is essential for anti-inflammatory functions in macrophages. This novel mechanism may potentially operate in vivo. Bone-marrow derived cells, including macrophages, are highly proliferating and require plasma LDL and cholesterol biosynthesis to provide cholesterol for new membrane production. By lowering the plasma LDL and inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statin therapy could generate macrophages with relatively less cholesterol in membranes, including the IMM, thereby promoting JMJD3 expression and anti-inflammatory function. This could contribute at least in part to observed anti-inflammatory effects of statins in human population.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/09/2023.01.09.523264"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523201", "title": "SemiBin2: self-supervised contrastive learning leads to better MAGs for short- and long-read sequencing", "authors": "Pan, S.; Zhao, X.-M.; Coelho, L.

Simulations using a coarse-grained Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model for (CAG)n repeats in monovalent salt solutions reproduce experimentally measured melting temperatures, which are available only for small n. By extending the simulations to large n, we show that the free energy gap, {Delta}GS, between the ground state (GS) and slipped hairpin (SH) states is a predictor of aggregation propensity. The GS for even n is a perfect hairpin (PH) whereas it is a SH when n is odd. The value of {Delta}GS (zero for odd n) is larger for even n than for odd n. As a result, the rate of dimer formation is slower in (CAG)30 relative to (CAG)31, thus linking {Delta}GS to RNA-RNA association. The yield of the dimer decreases dramatically, compared to the wild type, in mutant sequences in which the population of the SH is decreases substantially. Association between RNA chains is preceded by a transition to the SH even if the GS is a PH.

Therefore, signaling sexual attractiveness is expected to be tightly coordinated in communication systems synchronizing senders and receivers. Chemical signaling has permeated through all taxa of life as the earliest and most wide-spread form of communication and is particularly prevalent in insects. However, it has been notoriously difficult to decipher how exactly information related to sexual signaling is encoded in complex chemical profiles. Similarly, our knowledge of the genetic basis of sexual signaling is very limited and usually restricted to a few case studies with comparably simple pheromonal communication mechanisms. The present study jointly addresses these two knowledge gaps by characterizing a single gene simultaneously impacting sexual attractiveness and complex chemical surface profiles in parasitic wasps. Knocking down a fatty acid synthase gene in female wasps dramatically reduces their sexual attractiveness coinciding with a drastic decrease in male courtship and copulation behavior. Concordantly, we found a striking shift of methyl-branching patterns in the female surface pheromonal compounds, which we subsequently demonstrate to be the main cause for the greatly reduced male response. Intriguingly, this suggests a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness mediated by specific methyl-branching patterns, whose genetic underpinnings are not well understood despite their high potential for encoding information. Our study sheds light on how biologically relevant information can be encoded in complex chemical profiles and on the genetic basis of sexual attractiveness.\n\nSignificance StatementUnraveling the genetic basis of chemical signaling is one of the most prevalent yet challenging topics in functional genetics and animal communication studies. Here we present the characterization of a biosynthetic gene in parasitoid wasps that simultaneously impacts sexual attractiveness as well as majorly shifts complex surface pheromone compositions. The shifted pattern primarily constitutes up- and down-regulated methyl-branched compounds with very distinct branching positions. Therefore, these findings immediately suggest a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness in complex chemical profiles. This advances our understanding of how genetic information can be translated into biologically relevant chemical information and reveals that sexual attractiveness can have a comparably simple genetic basis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/09/2023.01.09.523239"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523226", "title": "Comparative genomics of smut fungi suggest the ability of meiosis and mating in asexual species of the genus Pseudozyma (Ustilaginales)", "authors": "Steins, L.; Guerreiro, M.

We proposed an alternative strategy of NET-stabilization with the chemokine, platelet factor 4 (PF4, CXCL4), which we have shown enhances NET-mediated microbial entrapment.

CeLab reduces the limitations of escaping and matricide that typically limit plate assays, revealing that feeding with heat-killed bacteria greatly extends lifespan and reproductive span of mated animals.

Mps1 is a conserved kinase involved in controlling aspects of chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. The mechanistic explanation for the Mps1-addiction of aneuploid cells is unknown. To address this question, we explored Mps1-dependence in yeast cells with increased sets of chromosomes. These experiments revealed that in yeast, increasing ploidy leads to delays and failures in orienting chromosomes on the mitotic spindle. Yeast cells with elevated numbers of chromosomes proved vulnerable to reductions of Mps1 activity. Cells with reduced Mps1 activity exhibit an extended prometaphase with longer spindles and delays in orienting the chromosomes. One known role of Mps1 is in recruiting Bub1 to the kinetochore in meiosis. We found that the Mps1-addiction of polyploid yeast cells is due in part to its role in Bub1 recruitment. Together, the experiments presented here demonstrate that increased ploidy renders cells more dependent on Mps1 for orienting chromosomes on the spindle.

Indeed, most cells in solid tumors carry abnormally elevated numbers of chromosomes. Mps1 is a regulator of the machinery that distributes chromosomes to daughter cells. In tumors with elevated chromosome numbers the expression of Mps1 is often also elevated. In some aneuploid tumor cell lines these elevated Mps1 levels have been shown to be critical for survival tumor survival. To determine how cells with higher ploidy become dependent on Mps1, we explored Mps1-dependence in yeast cells with increased numbers of chromosomes.

Such studies have shown that specific cellular structures, such as the oral apparatus, always form in specific regions of the cell, which raises the question of what is the source of positional information within this organism? By analogy with embryonic development, in which localized mRNA is often used to mark position, we asked whether position along the anterior-posterior axis of Stentor might be marked by specific regionalized mRNAs.

We repeated this analysis in cells in which a set of longitudinal microtubule bundles running down the whole length of the cell, known as KM-fibers, were disrupted by RNAi of {beta}-tubulin. We found that many messages either lost their regionalized distribution, or else switched to an opposite distribution, such that anterior-enriched messages in control became posterior-enriched in the RNAi cells, or vice versa.

Apo-Tf indicates an iron deficient environment and stimulates iron release, while holo-Tf indicates an iron sufficient environment and suppresses additional iron release. Free iron is exported through ferroportin, with hephaestin as an aid to the process. Until now, the molecular mechanism of apo- and holo-Tfs influence on iron release was largely unknown.\n\nMethodsHere we use a variety of cell culture techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay, in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and HEK 293 cells to investigate the mechanism of apo- and holo-Tfs influence over iron release. We placed our findings in physiological context by further deciphering how hepcidin played a role in this mechanism as well.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that holo-Tf induces the internalization of ferroportin through the established ferroportin degradation pathway. Furthermore, holo-Tf directly binds to ferroportin, whereas apo-Tf directly binds to hephaestin. Only pathological levels of hepcidin disrupt the interaction between holo-Tf and ferroportin, and no amount of hepcidin disrupts the interaction between apo-Tf and hephaestin. The disruption of the holo-Tf and ferroportin interaction by hepcidin is due to hepcidins ability to rapidly internalize ferroportin compared to holo-Tf.\n\nConclusionsThese novel findings provide a molecular mechanism for apo- and holo-Tf regulation of iron release from endothelial cells. They further demonstrate how hepcidin impacts these protein-protein interactions, and offer a model for how holo-Tf and hepcidin corporate to suppress iron release.

To this end, large datasets of drug response signatures have been curated, most notably the Connectivity Map (CMap) from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project. A multitude of in silico approaches have also been formulated to leverage drug signature data for accelerating novel therapeutics. However, the majority of the available data are from immortalized cancer cell lines. Cancer cells display markedly different responses to compounds, not only when compared to normal cells, but also among cancer types. Strategies for predicting drug signatures in unseen cells--cell lines not in the reference datasets--are still lacking.\n\nResultsIn this work we developed a computational strategy, called CrossTx, for predicting drug transcriptomic signatures of an unseen target cell line using drug transcriptome data of reference cell lines and background transcriptome data of the target cells. Our strategy involves the combination of predictor and corrector steps. Briefly, the Predictor applies averaging (mean) or linear regression model to the reference dataset to generate cell line-agnostic drug signatures. The Corrector generates target-specific drug signatures by projecting cell line-agnostic signatures from the Predictor onto the transcriptomic latent space of the target cell line using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and/or an Autoencoder (AE). We tested different combinations of Predictor-Corrector algorithms in an application to the CMap dataset to demonstrate the performance of our approach.\n\nConclusionCrossTx is an efficacious and generalizable method for predicting drug signatures in an unseen target cell line. Among the combinations tested, we found that the best strategy is to employ Mean as the Predictor and PCA followed by AE (PCA+AE) as the Corrector. Still, the combination of Mean and PCA (without AE) is an attractive strategy because of its computationally efficiency and simplicity, while offering only slightly less accurate drug signature predictions than the best performing combination.\n\nAvailability and implementationhttp://www.github.com/cabsel/crosstx\n\nContactrgunawan@buffalo.edu", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.09.523287"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523339", "title": "13C and 15N Resonance Assignments of Alpha Synuclein Fibrils Amplified from Lewy Body Dementia Tissue", "authors": "Barclay, A.

Today, how single cells responds to different extracellular cues has been comprehensibly studied. However, how the mechanical behavior of the main individual molecules that form an adhesion complex cooperatively respond to force within the adhesion complex has not been addressed. This is a key aspect in cell adhesion because how these cell adhesion molecules respond to force determines not only cell-matrix behavior but, ultimately, cell function. To answer this question, we develop a multi-scale computational model for adhesion complexes mechanics. Based on the classical clutch hypothesis, we model individual adhesion chains made of a contractile actin network, a talin rod and an integrin molecule that binds at individual adhesion sites on the extracellular matrix. We explore several scenarios of integrins dynamics and analyze the effects of diverse extracellular matrices on the behavior of the adhesion molecules and on the whole adhesion complex. Our results explains how every single component of the adhesion chain mechanically responds to the contractile actomyosin force and show how they control the tractions forces exerted by the cell on the extracellular space. Importantly, our computational results are in agreement with previous experimental data both at the molecular and cell level. Our multi-scale clutch model presents a step forward not only to further understand adhesion complexes mechanics but also to, e.g., engineer better biomimetic materials, repair biological tissues or arrest invasive tumor migration.\n\nAuthor summaryCell-matrix adhesions are directly implicated in key biological processes such as tissue development, regeneration and tumor cell invasion. These cell functions are determined by how adhesion complexes feel and respond to mechanical forces. Still, how forces are transmitted through the individual cell adhesion molecules that integrate the adhesion complex is poorly understood. To address this issue, we develop a multi-scale clutch model for adhesion complexes where individual adhesion chains, made of integrin and talin molecules, are considered within classical clutch models. This approach provides a rich mechanosensivity insight of how the mechanics of cell adhesion works. It allows to integrate accurate biophysical models of individual adhesion molecules into whole adhesion complex models. Our multi-scale clutch approach allows to extend our current knowledge of adhesion complexes for physiology and disease, e.g., the regeneration of biological tissues or arrest invasive tumor migration, and for engineering better biomimetic materials.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.09.523273"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523307", "title": "DNA-origami line-actants control domain organisation and fission in synthetic membranes", "authors": "Rubio-Sanchez, R.; Cicuta, P.; Mognetti, B.

Large-scale efficient computation of tissue oxygen concentration is dependent on the manner in which the tubular network of blood vessels is coupled to the tissue mesh. Models which explicitly resolve the interface between the tissue and vasculature with a contiguous mesh are prohibitively expensive for very dense cerebral microvasculature. We propose a mixed-domain mesh-free technique whereby a vascular anatomical network (VAN) represented as a thin directed graph serves for convection of blood oxygen, and the surrounding extravascular tissue is represented as a Cartesian grid of 3D voxels throughout which oxygen is transported by diffusion.

There is evidence suggesting population differences in genetic maps, and thus estimating population-specific maps are of interest. While the recent availability of biobank-scale data offers such opportunities, current methods are not efficient at leveraging very large sample sizes. The most accurate methods are still linkage-disequilibrium (LD)-based methods that are only tractable for a few hundred samples. In this work, we propose a fast and memory-efficient method for estimating genetic maps from population genotyping data. Our method, FastRecomb, leverages the efficient positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) data structure for counting IBD segment boundaries as potential recombination events. We used PBWT blocks to avoid redundant counting of pairwise matches. Moreover, we used a panel smoothing technique to reduce the noise from errors and recent mutations. Using simulation, we found that FastRecomb achieves state-of-the-art performance at 10k resolution, in terms of correlation coefficients between the estimated map and the ground truth. This is mainly due to the fact that FastRecomb can effectively take advantage of large panels comprising more than hundreds of thousands of haplotypes. At the same time, other methods lack the efficiency to handle such data. We believe further refinement of FastRecomb would deliver more accurate genetic maps for the genetics community.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.09.523304"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523362", "title": "BRDriver: Breast Cancer Driver Gene Predictor", "authors": "Perera, R.; Perera, R.", "author_corresponding": "Rajitha Perera", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Sri Jayewardenepura", "date": "2023-01-10", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "The breast cancer mortality rate is high in developing countries as the early detection of cancer is deficient in patients. The identification of the genes that drive cancer is one of the major approaches in the early detection of breast cancer. Several computational tools have been developed to predict the cancer driver genes. However, there is no gold-standard method for identifying breast cancer driver genes. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model to predict high-confidence breast cancer diver genes using already-developed computational tools and already-produced breast cancer data. Primary breast cancer data were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Here we use twenty-seven different gene prediction tools that calculate each genes effect and variant in the primary gene dataset. The primary dataset feeds as the input for each tool. The results retrieved from each tool are recorded as the secondary dataset. The latest breast cancer driver gene set was retrieved from DriverDBv3 and included as the target attribute. Training and testing subsets were selected using k-fold cross-validation from the secondary dataset. Attributes from the secondary dataset were ranked according to their correlation with breast cancer driver genes. The ranked data were trained using different supervised machine-learning algorithms. The attributes and the learning algorithm which produced the highest classification accuracy were selected to build the new model, BReast cancer Driver (BRDriver). The new model BRDriver achieved 0.999 area under the curve and 0.999 classification accuracy on breast invasive carcinoma data. TP53 was the most predicted breast cancer drive gene (n=246) predicted by BRDriver. Interestingly, our BRDriver model predicted CDKN2A and NFE2L2 genes as new breast cancer driver genes. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to determine whether these genes are indeed cancer-driver genes. Many computational tools developed to identify the cancer driver genes and variants.

Disruption of this finely tuned cycle can lead to a range of diseases including cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Cardiac contraction is driven by the molecular motor myosin, which pulls regulated thin filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. In some muscle and non-muscle myosins, regulatory proteins on actin tune the kinetics, mechanics, and load dependence of the myosin working stroke; however, it is not well understood whether or how thin filament regulatory proteins tune the mechanics of the cardiac myosin motor. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we used single-molecule techniques to measure the kinetics and mechanics of the substeps of the cardiac myosin working stroke in the presence and absence of thin filament regulatory proteins. We found that regulatory proteins gate the calcium-dependent interactions between myosin and the thin filament. At physiologically relevant ATP concentrations, cardiac myosins mechanics and unloaded kinetics are not affected by thin filament regulatory proteins. We also measured the load-dependent kinetics of cardiac myosin at physiologically relevant ATP concentrations using an isometric optical clamp, and we found that thin filament regulatory proteins do not affect either the identity or magnitude of myosins primary load-dependent transition. Interestingly, at low ATP concentrations, thin filament regulatory proteins have a small effect on actomyosin dissociation kinetics, suggesting a mechanism beyond simple steric blocking. These results have important implications for both disease modeling and computational models of muscle contraction.\n\nSignificance StatementHuman heart contraction is powered by the molecular motor {beta}-cardiac myosin, which pulls on thin filaments consisting of actin and the regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin. In some muscle and non-muscle systems, these regulatory proteins tune the kinetics, mechanics, and load dependence of the myosin working stroke. Despite having a central role in health and disease, it is not well understood whether the mechanics or kinetics of {beta}-cardiac myosin are affected by regulatory proteins.

N-803 is an IL-15 superagonist that expands CD8+ T cells and increases their cytotoxicity. N-803 also temporarily reduced viral load in a limited subset of non-human primates infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a model of HIV. However, viral suppression has not been observed in all SIV cohorts and may depend on pre-treatment viral load and the corresponding effects on CD8+ T cells. Starting from an existing mechanistic mathematical model of N-803 immunotherapy of SIV, we develop a model that includes activation of SIV-specific and non-SIV-specific CD8+ T cells by antigen, inflammation, and N-803. Also included is a regulatory counter-response that inhibits CD8+ T cell proliferation and function, representing the effects of immune checkpoint molecules and immunosuppressive cells. We simultaneously calibrate the model to two separate SIV cohorts. The first cohort had low viral loads prior to treatment ({approx}3-4 log viral RNA copy equivalents (CEQ)/mL), and N-803 treatment transiently suppressed viral load. The second had higher pre-treatment viral loads ({approx}5-7 log CEQ/mL) and saw no consistent virus suppression with N-803. The mathematical model can replicate the viral and CD8+ T cell dynamics of both cohorts based on different pre-treatment viral loads and different levels of regulatory inhibition of CD8+ T cells due to those viral loads (i.e. initial conditions of model). Our predictions are validated by additional data from these and other SIV cohorts. While both cohorts had high numbers of activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in simulations, viral suppression was precluded in the high viral load cohort due to elevated inhibition of cytotoxicity. Thus, we mathematically demonstrate how the pre-treatment viral load can influence immunotherapeutic efficacy, highlighting the in vivo conditions and combination therapies that could maximize efficacy and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryImmunotherapy bolsters and redirects the immune system to fight chronic infections and cancers. However, the effectiveness of some immunotherapies may depend on the level of pre-treatment inflammation and the corresponding presence of regulatory cells and immune checkpoint molecules that normally function to prevent immune overreaction. Here, we consider two previously published cohorts of macaques who were given the immunotherapeutic N-803 to treat Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, an analog of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). One cohort had low viral loads before treatment, and N-803 temporarily suppressed viral loads. The second cohort had high viral loads that did not consistently decrease with N-803 treatment. In this work, we demonstrate with a mathematical model how these two distinct outcomes can arise due only to the different viral loads and the corresponding immune activation and regulatory response. In the model, we find that the key limiting factor is the direct inhibition of the cytotoxic action of immune cells by immune checkpoint molecules. This model indicates that simultaneous blockade of immune checkpoint molecules may be necessary for effective application of N-803 for the treatment of HIV. This and similar models can inform the design of such combination therapies for cancer and chronic infection.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.09.523305"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.09.523238", "title": "Integration of transcriptomics data into agent-based models of solid tumor metastasis", "authors": "Retzlaff, J.; Lai, X.; Berking, C.; Vera, J.", "author_corresponding": "Julio Vera", "author_corresponding_institution": "FAU Erlangen-Nuernberg", "date": "2023-01-10", "category": "systems biology", "abstract": "Most of the recent progress in our understanding of cancer relies in the systematic profiling of patient samples with high throughput techniques like transcriptomics.

Specific branches with sites under diversifying selection include: three coastal/estuarine species which have recently diverged from closely-related lineages inhabiting freshwater (Cephalorhynchus commersonii, Sotalia guianensis and Orcaella heinsohni - CDH23), and three species that operate specialized Narrow Band High Frequency Sonars (Phocoena sinus - SLC26A5, Neophocaena phocaenoides and Cephalorhynchus commersonii - CDH23). All positively selected lineages are coastal or estuarine from shallow waters (< 100), corroborating current knowledge on these species sonars. Among river dolphin branches, positive selection was found on specific sites of the genes CDH23 and SLC26A5, when compared to other cetaceans and Laurasiatherians. Finally, the detection of sites with different overall substitution rates (dN/dS) among river and marine dolphins, together with the finding of different amounts of positively selected sites in each environmental group, suggests distinct selective pressures acting in these groups in the molecular evolution of echolocation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.10.523466"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.10.523318", "title": "Long Non-Coding RNA Generated from CDKN1A Gene by Alternative Polyadenylation Regulates p21 Expression during DNA Damage Response", "authors": "Murphy, M.

We named this lncRNA SPUD (Selective Polyadenylation Upon Damage). SPUD localizes to polysomes in the cytoplasm and is detectable as multiple isoforms in available high throughput studies. SPUD has low abundance compared to the CDKN1A full-length isoform and is induced in cancer and normal cells under a variety of DNA damaging conditions in part through p53 transcriptional activation. RNA binding protein (RBP) HuR and the transcriptional repressor CTCF regulate SPUD levels. SPUD induction increases p21 protein, but not CDKN1A full-length levels, affecting p21 functions in cell-cycle, CDK2 expression, and cell viability. Like CDKN1A full-length isoform, SPUD can bind two competitive p21 translational regulators, the inhibitor calreticulin and the activator CUGBP1; SPUD can change their association with CDKN1A full-length in a DDR-dependent manner.

This study aims to address common and tissue-specific sex differences in metabolism in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), lens and brain under fed and fasted conditions.\n\nMethodsAfter ad libitum fed or deprived of food for 18 hours, mouse eye tissues (retina, RPE/choroid, and lens), brain, and plasma were harvested for targeted metabolomics. The data were analyzed with both Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Volcano Plot analysis.\n\nResultsAmong 133 metabolites that cover major metabolic pathways, we found 9-45 metabolites that are sex-different in different tissues under the fed state and 6-18 metabolites under the fasted state. Among these sex-different metabolites, 33 were changed in two or more tissues, and 64 were tissue-specific. Pantothenic acid, hypotaurine and 4-hydroxyproline were the top commonly changed metabolites. Lens and retina had the most tissue-specific sex-different metabolites enriched in the metabolism of amino acid, nucleotide, lipids and TCA cycle. Lens and brain had more similar sex-different metabolites than other occular tissues. Female RPE and female brain were more sensitive to fasting with more reduced metabolites in amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and glycolysis. The plasma had the least sex-different metabolites with very few overlapping changes with tissues.\n\nConclusionSex has a strong influence on eye and brain metabolism in tissue-specific and metabolic state-specific manners.

Here, we show, for two classes of input signals, that cellular networks can reach the fundamental bound on the predictive information as set by the information extracted from the past signal: pushpull networks can reach this information bound for Markovian signals, while networks that take a temporal derivative can reach the bound for predicting the future derivative of non-Markovian signals.

To date, the process of passage of 8 m RBCs through 0.3-m wide slits remains enigmatic. Should the slits increase their caliber during RBC passage as sometimes proposed in the literature? Here, we elucidated the mechanisms that govern the passage dynamics or retention of RBCs in slits by combining multiscale modeling, live imaging, and microfluidic experiments on an original device with slits of defined physiological dimensions, including submicron width. We observed that healthy RBCs pass through 0.28-m wide rigid slits at body temperature. To achieve this tour de force, they must meet two requirements. Geometrically, their surface area-to-volume ratio must be compatible with a shape in two tether-connected equal spheres. Mechanically, they must be able to locally unfold their spectrin cytoskeleton inside the slits. In contrast, activation of the mechanosensitive PIEZO1 channel is not required. The RBC transit time through slits scales with in-slit pressure drop and slit width to the -1 and -3 power, respectively. This transit dynamics is similar to that of a Newtonian fluid in a 2D Poiseuille flow, thus showing that it is controlled by the RBC cytoplasmic viscosity. Altogether, our results clearly show that filtration through submicron-wide slits is possible without further slit opening. Furthermore, our approach addresses the critical need for in-vitro evaluation of splenic clearance of diseased or engineered RBCs for transfusion and drug delivery.\n\nSignificance StatementSplenic filtration of red blood cells through narrow interendothelial slits remains poorly understood despite its physiological significance as experiments and imaging of red cells passing through the slits are lacking. Here, we coupled live imaging, biomimetic submicron-fluidics, and multiscale modeling to quantify passage conditions. Remarkably, healthy 8-m cells can pass through 0.28-m slits at body temperature. This event is conditioned to cells being able to deform into two tether-connected equal spheres and to unfold their spectrin cytoskeleton. We showed that cells behave like a Newtonian fluid and that their dynamics is controlled by the inner fluid viscosity We thus propose an in-vitro and in-silico approach to quantify splenic clearance of diseased cells and cells engineered for transfusion and drug delivery", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/10/2023.01.10.523245"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.10.523459", "title": "Disease-associated patterns of acetylation stabilize tau fibril formation", "authors": "Li, L.; Nguyen, B.; Mullapudi, V.; Saelices, L.; Joachimiak, L.

It has been proposed that post-translational modifications may drive tau assembly but no direct mechanism for how modifications drive assembly has emerged. Leveraging established aggregation-regulating tau fragments that are normally inert, we tested the effect of chemical modification of lysines with acetyl groups on tau fragment conversion into amyloid aggregates. We identify specific patterns of acetylation that flank amyloidogenic motifs on the tau fragments that drive rapid fibril assembly. To understand how this pattern of acetylation may drive assembly, we determined a 3.9 [A] cryo-EM structure of an amyloid fibril assembled from an acetylated tau fragment. The structure uncovers how lysine acetylation patterns mediate gain-of-function interactions to promote amyloid assembly.

However, it is largely unknown what regulatory changes may associate with these phenotypic traits, and whether these are unique to the naked mole-rat, the mole-rat clade or also present in other mammals. Here, we investigate regulatory evolution in heart and liver from two African mole-rat species and two rodent outgroups using genome-wide epigenomic profiling.\n\nFirst, we adapted and applied a phylogenetic modeling approach to quantitatively compare epigenomic signals at orthologous regulatory elements, and identified thousands of promoter and enhancer regions with differential epigenomic activity in mole-rats. These elements associate with known mole-rat adaptation in metabolic and functional pathways, and suggest candidate genetic loci that may underlie mole-rat innovations. Second, we evaluated ancestral and species-specific regulatory changes in the study phylogeny, and report several candidate pathways experiencing stepwise remodeling during the evolution of mole-rats - such as the insulin and hypoxia response pathways. Third, we report non-orthologous regulatory elements overlap with lineage-specific repetitive elements and appear to modify metabolic pathways by rewiring of HNF4 and RAR/RXR transcription factor binding sites in mole-rats.\n\nThese comparative analyses reveal how mole-rat regulatory evolution informs previously reported phenotypic adaptations. Moreover, the phylogenetic modeling framework we propose here improves upon the state-of-the-art by addressing known limitations of inter-species comparisons of epigenomic profiles, and has broad implications in the field of comparative functional genomics.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.10.523217"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.11.523546", "title": "Virome analyses by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in chilli (Capsicum anuum L.) presented with diverse symptoms phenotype revealed the association of seven plant viruses", "authors": "Reddy, N.

In the present study, virome analyses in infected chilli leaf samples was carried out using NGS to know the diversity of both known and unknown viruses associated with diseased symptoms. For virome profiling, samples from 19 fields were collected from chilli plants showing leaf curling, vein banding, mosaic, mottling, shoestring/rat tail/filiform/leathery and dull coloured leaves. Viral disease incidence in the surveyed fields varied from 26.66% to 47.50%. Total RNA was extracted from the 19 chilli leaf samples collected from fields and were pooled at equimolar concentration for virome profiling. From the rRNA-depleted pooled total RNA, mRNA and sRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NOVASEQ 6000 platform. Raw sequence data obtained was de novo assembled using three approaches; mRNAome with Trinity, sRNAome with Velvet and whole transcriptome (WT) with SPAdes assembly. Chilli virome, pairwise sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of seven different viruses; chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) along with its associated alpha and betasatellites, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), groundnut bud necrosis orthotospovirus (GBNV), pepper cryptic virus-2 (PCV-2), pepper vein yellows virus (PeVYV), bell pepper alphaendornavirus (BPEV) and tobacco vein clearing virus (TVCV).

SURFBAT provides an association test that is inherently robust to fine-scale population stratification and opens up the possibility of efficiently using large imputation reference panels as control groups for association testing. The method is suitable when the control panel spans the local ancestry spectrum of the case-group population and each control has similar paternal and maternal ancestries. This is the case for our reference panels where individuals have their four grand-parents born in the same geographic area.

Developing these BMIs requires advances in neuroscience and electronic technology, as well as using low-complexity spike detection algorithms and high-performance machine learning models. While some state-of-the-art BMI systems jointly design spike detection algorithms and machine learning models, it remains unclear how the detection performance affects decoding.\n\nApproachWe propose the co-design of the neural decoder with an ultra-low complexity spike detection algorithm. The detection algorithm is designed to attain a target firing rate, which the decoder uses to modulate the input features preserving statistical invariance.\n\nMain resultsWe demonstrate a multiplication-free fixed-point spike detection algorithm with nearly perfect detection accuracy and the lowest complexity among studies we have seen. By co-designing the system to incorporate statistically invariant features, we observe significantly improved long-term stability, with decoding accuracy degrading by less than 10% after 80 days of operation. Our analysis also reveals a nonlinear relationship between spike detection and decoding performance. Increasing the detection sensitivity improves decoding accuracy and long-term stability, which means the activity of more neurons is beneficial despite the detection of more noise. Reducing the spike detection sensitivity still provides acceptable decoding accuracy whilst reducing the bandwidth by at least 30%.\n\nSignificanceOur findings regarding the relationship between spike detection and decoding performance can provide guidance on setting the threshold for spike detection rather than relying on training or trial-and-error. The trade-off between data bandwidth and decoding performance can be effectively managed using appropriate spike detection settings. We demonstrate improved decoding performance by maintaining statistical invariance of input features.

Sour cherry is an allotetraploid with few genomic resources, so a genome sequence would greatly facilitate the improvement of this crop. In Prunus, two known classes of genes are of particular importance to breeding strategies: the self-incompatibility loci (S-alleles), which determine compatible crosses and are critically important for successful fertilization and fruit set, and the Dormancy Associated MADS-box genes (DAMs), which strongly affect dormancy transitions and flowering time.\n\nResultsHere we report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for sour cherry cultivar  Montmorency, the predominant sour cherry cultivar grown in the U.S. We also generated a draft assembly of P. fruticosa to use alongside a published P. avium sequence for syntelog-based subgenome assignments for  Montmorency. Using hierarchal k-mer clustering and phylogenomics, we provide compelling evidence this allotetraploid is trigenomic, containing two distinct subgenomes inherited from a P. fruticosa-like ancestor (A and A) and two copies of the same subgenome inherited from a P. avium-like ancestor (BB). We therefore assigned the genome composition of  Montmorency to be AABB and show little to no recombination has occurred between progenitor subgenomes (A/A and B).

As metabolites are often molecular signals, metabolite diffusion within microbial communities can affect the composition and dynamics of the community in a manner that can be challenging to deconstruct. We used encapsulation of a synthetic microbial community within microdroplets to investigate the effects of spatial structure and metabolite diffusion on population dynamics and to examine the effects of cheating by one member of the community. The synthetic community was comprised of three strains: a  Producer that makes the diffusible quorum sensing molecule (N-(3-Oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, C12-oxo-HSL) or AHL; a  Receiver that is killed by AHL and a Non-Producer or  cheater that benefits from the extinction of the Receivers, but without the costs associated with the AHL synthesis. We demonstrate that despite rapid diffusion of AHL between microdroplets, the spatial structure imposed by the microdroplets allow a more efficient but transient enrichment of more rare and slower growing  Producer subpopulations. Eventually, the Non-Producer population drove the Producers to extinction. By including fluorescence-activated microdroplet sorting and providing sustained competition by the Receiver strain, we demonstrate a strategy for indirect enrichment of a rare and unlabeled Producer.

Moreover, the slow throughput and the limited dynamic range of currently used endpoint assays such as Western blotting, does not allow the comprehensive analysis of PROTAC SAR series. To this end, we developed fluorescent based assays using NanoLuciferase and HaloTag based technologies, that allow measuring PROTAC induced ternary complex formation kinetics and stability between the target protein and the chosen E3 ligase. Using available PROTACs developed for degradation of WDR5, the comprehensive characterization of the mode of action of these PROTACs in the early degradation cascade revealed a key role of ternary complex formation and stability over the corresponding binary PROTAC-WDR5 and PROTAC-E3 complexes. Comparing a series of ternary complex crystal structures highlighted the importance of an efficient E3-target interface for ternary complex stability. The developed assays outline a strategy for the rational optimization of PROTACs using a series of live cell assays monitoring key steps of the early PROTAC induced degradation pathway.\n\nSignificanceThe multistep PROTAC induced degradation process of a POI poses a significant challenge for the rational design of these bifunctional small molecules as critical steps that limit PROTAC efficacy cannot be easily assayed at required throughput. In addition, the cellular location of the POI may pose additional challenges as some cellular compartments, such as the nucleus, may not be easily reached by PROTAC molecules and the targeted E3 ligases may not be present in this cellular compartment. As a consequence, PROTACs would be best are evaluated in cellular environments using a sensor system that allows continuous monitoring of the protein levels of the endogenous POI. Here we developed a cell line expressing WDR5 from its endogenous locus in fusion with a small sequence tag (HiBIT) that can be reconstituted to function NanoLuciferase (NLuc). This system allowed continuous monitoring of endogenous WDR5 levels in cells and together with Halo tagged E3 ligases also the continuous monitoring of ternary complex (E3, WDR5 and PROTAC) formation. As this assay can be run at high throughput, we used this versatile system monitoring three diverse sets of WDR5 PROTACs that markedly differ in their degradation properties. Monitoring cell penetration, binary complex formation (PROTAC-WDR5 and PROTAC-VHL) as well as ternary complex formation we found that PROTAC efficiency highly correlated with synergy of ternary complex formation in cells. This study represents a first data set on diverse PROTACs studying this property in cellulo and it outlines a strategy for the rational optimization of PROTACs. It also provided kinetic data on ternary complex assembly and dissociation that may serve as a benchmark for future studies utilizing also kinetic properties for PROTAC development.

Most prior host genetic HIV studies have focused on identifying DNA polymorphisms (e.g., CCR5{Delta}32, MHC class I alleles) associated with viral load among untreated \"elite controllers\" (~1% of HIV+ individuals who are able to control virus without ART). However, there have been few studies evaluating host genetic predictors of viral control for the majority of people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART. We performed host RNA sequencing and HIV reservoir quantification (total DNA, unspliced RNA, intact DNA) from peripheral CD4+ T cells from 191 HIV+ ART-suppressed non-controllers. Multivariate models included covariates for timing of ART initiation, nadir CD4+ count, age, sex, and ancestry. Lower HIV total DNA (an estimate of the total reservoir) was associated with upregulation of tumor suppressor genes NBL1 (q=0.012) and P3H3 (q=0.012). Higher HIV unspliced RNA (an estimate of residual HIV transcription) was associated with downregulation of several host genes involving inflammasome (IL1A, CSF3, TNFAIP5, TNFAIP6, TNFAIP9, CXCL3, CXCL10) and innate immune (TLR7) signaling, as well as novel associations with potassium (KCNJ2) and gap junction (GJB2) channels, all q<0.05. Gene set enrichment analyses identified significant associations with TLR4/microbial translocation (q=0.006), IL-1{beta}/NRLP3 inflammasome (q=0.008), and IL-10 (q=0.037) signaling. HIV intact DNA (an estimate of the \"replication-competent\" reservoir) demonstrated trends with thrombin degradation (PLGLB1) and glucose metabolism (AGL) genes, but data were (HIV intact DNA detected in only 42% of participants). Our findings demonstrate that among treated PLWH, that inflammation, innate immune responses, bacterial translocation, and tumor suppression/cell proliferation host signaling play a key role in the maintenance of the HIV reservoir during ART. Further data are needed to validate these findings, including functional genomic studies, and expanded epidemiologic studies in female, non-European cohorts.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough lifelong HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses virus, the major barrier to an HIV cure is the persistence of infected cells that evade host immune surveillance despite effective ART, \"the HIV reservoir.\" HIV eradication strategies have focused on eliminating residual virus to allow for HIV remission, but HIV cure trials to date have thus far failed to show a clinically meaningful reduction in the HIV reservoir. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the host-viral dynamics during ART suppression to identify potential novel therapeutic targets for HIV cure. This is the first epidemiologic host gene expression study to demonstrate a significant link between HIV reservoir size and several well-known immunologic pathways (e.g., IL-1{beta}, TLR7, TNF- signaling pathways), as well as novel associations with potassium and gap junction channels (Kir2.1, connexin 26).

In contrast to upregulating HNF4 transcription, SMAD2/3 represses C/EBP transcription. Therefore, long-term TGF-{beta} incubation results in C/EBP depletion, which inhibits HNF4 expression.

Using single-neuron, in vivo labelling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargo, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. In addition to its microtubule binding CH domain, mammalian EB1 interacted with mammalian KIF1A in an EBH domain dependent manner, and expression of mammalian EB1 or the EBH domain was sufficient to rescue DCV transport in ebp-1 mutants. Our results suggest a model in which kinesin-3 binding and microtubule binding by EBP-1 cooperate to transiently enrich the motor near sites of DCV biogenesis to promote motor-cargo association.

In order to reach the objective, set by the World Health Organization to decrease the cases by 2030, antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action are required.

Increased intracellular calcium induces the suicidal death of erythrocytes also known as eryptosis. This study aimed to identify the hallmarks of eryptosis due to calcium redistribution and the downstream cellular effects during CQ treatment in iRBCs. Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 at mid-late trophozoites were used for the antimalarial drug treatment. Our results revealed increased phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, delineating an eryptotic phenotype in the host RBC. Interestingly, the blebs on the surface of the iRBCs released to the extracellular milieu become extracellular vesicles (EVs) which are essential for intercellular communication due to their cargo of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and metabolites. The proteomic characterization displayed 2 highly enriched protein clusters in EVs from CQ-treated iRBCs, the proteasome and ribosome. We demonstrated that this unique protein cargo is not associated with the parasite growth rate.

Many of these effects appear to result from the impact of RasV12 signalling on actomyosin contractility, since RasV12 induces the severing of retraction fibres that normally guide spindle positioning and provide a memory of the interphase cell shape. In support of this idea, the RasV12 phenotype is reversed by inhibition of actomyosin contractility, and can be mimicked by the loss of cell-substrate adhesion during mitosis.

We utilize two complementary models, HEK293 cells and human iPSC-derived neurons, and delineate RBM12 as a novel repressor of the G protein-coupled receptor/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (GPCR/cAMP/PKA) signaling axis. We establish that loss of RBM12 leads to hyperactive cAMP production and increased PKA activity as well as altered neuronal transcriptional responses to GPCR stimulation. Notably, the cAMP and transcriptional signaling steps are subject to discrete RBM12-dependent regulation. We further demonstrate that the two RBM12 truncating variants linked to familial psychosis impact this interplay, as the mutants fail to rescue GPCR/cAMP signaling hyperactivity in cells depleted of RBM12. Lastly, we present a mechanism underlying the impaired signaling phenotypes. In agreement with its activity as an RNA-binding protein, loss of RBM12 leads to altered gene expression, including that of multiple effectors of established significance within the receptor pathway.

We note that these expression changes are fully consistent with the entire gamut of hyperactive signaling outputs.

We show that standard TOs containing the STB layer inside the organoid (STBin) develop into organoids containing the STB on the outer surface (STBout) when cultured in suspension with gentle agitation. STBout organoids secrete higher levels of hormones and cytokines from the STB, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and interferon (IFN)-{lambda}2.

The pathogenicity of C. diff. infection is derived from two major toxins, toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). Peptide inhibitors that can be delivered to the gut to inactivate these toxins are an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this work, we present a new approach that combines a peptide binding design algorithm (PepBD), molecular-level simulations, rapid screening of candidate peptides for toxin binding, a primary human cell-based assay, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements to develop peptide inhibitors that block the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdA by targeting its glucosyltransferase domain (GTD). Using PepBD and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we identified seven candidate peptides, SA1-SA7. These peptides were selected for specific TcdA GTD binding through a custom solid-phase peptide screening system, which eliminated the weaker inhibitors SA5-SA7. The efficacies of SA1-SA4 were then tested using a trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay on monolayers of the human gut epithelial culture model. One peptide, SA1, was found to block TcdA toxicity in primary-derived human jejunum (small intestinal) and colon (large intestinal) epithelial cells. SA1 bound TcdA with a KD of 56.1 {+/-} 29.8 nM as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).\n\nSignificance StatementInfections by Clostridioides difficile, a bacterium that targets the large intestine (colon), impact a significant number of people worldwide.

We interrogated cell type expression patterns of 126 V. carteri predicted RBP encoding genes and found 40 that showed either somatic or germ cell expression bias.

The identification of mechanisms that are specific to certain cell types is crucial for building useful models and to gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Regularization techniques have been proposed and applied to identify mechanisms specific to two cell types, e.g., healthy and cancer cells, including the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). However, when analyzing more than two cell types, these approaches are not consistent, and require the selection of a reference cell type, which can affect the results.\n\nTo make the regularization approach applicable to identifying cell-type specific mechanisms in any number of cell types, we propose to incorporate the clustered LASSO into the framework of ordinary differential equation modeling by penalizing the pairwise differences of the logarithmized fold-change parameters encoding a specific mechanism in different cell types. The symmetry introduced by this approach renders the results independent of the reference cell type. We discuss the necessary adaptations of state-of-the-art numerical optimization techniques and the process of model selection for this method. We assess the performance with realistic biological models and synthetic data, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing approaches.

However, constructing useful models can be challenging, since they both need a certain amount of complexity to adequately describe real-world observations, and simultaneously enough simplicity to enable understanding of these observations and precise predictions. Regularization techniques were suggested to tackle this challenge, especially when building models that describe two different types of cells, such as healthy and cancer cells. Typically, both cell types have a large portion of biological mechanisms in common, and the task is to identify the relevant differences that need to be included into the model.\n\nFor more than two types of cells, the existing approaches are not readily applicable, because they require defining one of the cell types as reference, which potentially influences the results. In this work, we present a regularization method that is independent from the choice of a reference. We demonstrate its working principle and compare its performance to existing approaches.

Such one-carbon unit production plays a critical role in development, the immune system, and cancer. Here we show that the whole-body SHMT flux acts to net consume rather than produce glycine. Pharmacological inhibition of whole-body SHMT1/2 and genetic knockout of liver SHMT2 elevated circulating glycine levels up to eight-fold. Stable isotope tracing revealed that the liver converts glycine to serine, which is then converted by serine dehydratase into pyruvate and burned in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

How TTC5 initiates decay of tubulin mRNAs is unknown. Here, our biochemical and structural analysis reveals that TTC5 recruits the poorly studied protein SCAPER to the ribosome. SCAPER in turn engages the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex through its CNOT11 subunit to trigger tubulin mRNA decay. SCAPER mutants that cause intellectual disability and retinitis pigmentosa in humans are impaired in CCR4-NOT recruitment, tubulin mRNA degradation, and microtubule-dependent chromosome segregation.

Intermediate species have been reported to be more toxic than mature amyloid fibrils. Hence, the focus of the current work is to understand both structural and mechanistic role of intermediates in the early stages of amyloid self-assembly in amyloidogenic peptides. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method were utilized to investigate structural changes that lead to amyloid formation in amphibian peptide uperin-3.5 (U3.5), an antimicrobial and amyloidogenic peptide. Microsecond time-scale MD simulations revealed that peptide aggregation, into {beta}-sheet dominated aggregates, is centred on two important factors; evolution of -helical intermediates and the critical role of local peptide concentration inside these aggregates. Electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged aspartate (D) and arginine (R) residues located near the N-terminus induced hydrogen bonding resulting in formation of precursor 310-helices close to the N-terminus. The 310-helices transitioned into -helices, thereby imparting partial helical conformations to the peptides. In the initial stages of aggregation, U3.5 peptides with amphipathic, partial helices aggregated to form small clusters of helical intermediates directed via hydrophobic interactions. These helices imparted stability to the helical intermediates, which promoted growth of clusters by further addition of peptides. This led to an increase in the local peptide concentration which enabled stronger peptide-peptide interactions and triggered a {beta}-sheet transition in these aggregates. Thus, the study emphasized that stabilisation of peptide helical content may be crucial to the evolution of {beta}-sheet-rich amyloid structures.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/12/2023.01.11.523545"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.11.523625", "title": "The molecular mechanism of monovalent cation selectivity in the TRPM5 channel", "authors": "Ives, C.

Here we used transposon directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), a genome-wide approach, to identify 249 genes involved in P. protegens Pf-5 swimming motility. As expected, flagella and chemotaxis genes comprised a large proportion of these genes. However we also identified a suite of additional genes important for swimming, including genes related to peptidoglycan turnover, O-antigen biosynthesis, cell division, signal transduction, c-di-GMP turnover and phosphate transport, along with 27 conserved hypothetical proteins. Experimental gene knockout mutants and TraDIS data together suggest that defects in the Pst phosphate transporter lead to enhanced swimming motility. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of pseudomonad motility and highlights the utility of a TraDIS-based approach for systematically analyzing the functions of thousands of genes. This work sets a foundation for understanding how swimming motility may be related to the inconsistency in biocontrol bacteria effectiveness and reliability in the field.\n\nImportanceBiocontrol bacteria, such as Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 are increasingly being used as an agricultural tool to control crop diseases, and motility is a key factor in their successful colonization of plant surfaces. Here we use a high-throughput approach to identify the suite of genes important for swimming motility in P. protegens Pf-5. These included flagella and chemotaxis genes, as well as a variety of cell surface, cell division and signalling genes. We also show that defects in the Pst phosphate transporter lead to enhanced swimming motility, a hitherto unreported link between phosphate transport and swimming motility. Understanding the genetic basis of swimming motility enhances our knowledge of key processes in biocontrol bacteria that are needed to ensure their competitive success.

We have discovered the Caenorhabditis elegans homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HPK-1) acts as a key transcriptional effector to preserve neuronal integrity, function, and proteostasis during aging. Loss of hpk-1 results in drastic dysregulation in expression of neuronal genes, including genes associated with neuronal aging. During normal aging hpk-1 expression increases throughout the nervous system more broadly than any other kinase. Within the aging nervous system, hpk-1 is co-expressed with key longevity transcription factors, including daf-16 (FOXO), hlh-30 (TFEB), skn-1 (Nrf2), and hif-1, which suggests hpk-1 expression mitigates natural age-associated physiological decline. Consistently, pan-neuronal overexpression of hpk-1 extends longevity, preserves proteostasis both within and outside of the nervous system, and improves stress resistance. Neuronal HPK-1 improves proteostasis through kinase activity. HPK-1 functions cell non-autonomously within serotonergic and GABAergic neurons to improve proteostasis in distal tissues by specifically regulating distinct components of the proteostatic network. Increased serotonergic HPK-1 enhances the heat shock response and survival to acute stress. In contrast, GABAergic HPK-1 induces basal autophagy and extends longevity. Our work establishes hpk-1 as a key neuronal transcriptional regulator critical for preservation of neuronal function during aging.

Rab35 recruits MICAL1 to oxidate and depolymerize actin filaments.

To achieve cellular therapies aimed at restoring and/or replacing defective gastrointestinal tissue, it is important to understand the natural mechanisms of tissue regeneration. We employed a combination of high throughput sequencing approaches, mouse genetic models, and murine and human organoid models, and identified a role for TGFB signaling during intestinal regeneration following injury. At 2 days following irradiation (IR)-induced damage of intestinal crypts, a surge in TGFB1 expression is mediated by monocyte/macrophage cells at the location of damage. Depletion of macrophages or genetic disruption of TGFB-signaling significantly impaired the regenerative response following irradiation. Murine intestinal regeneration is also characterized by a process where a fetal transcriptional signature is induced during repair. In organoid culture, TGFB1-treatment was necessary and sufficient to induce a transcriptomic shift to the fetal-like/regenerative state. The regenerative response was enhanced by the function of mesenchymal cells, which are also primed for regeneration by TGFB1. Mechanistically, integration of ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, and ChIP-seq suggest that a regenerative YAP-SOX9 transcriptional circuit is activated in epithelium exposed to TGFB1. Finally, pre-treatment with TGFB1 enhanced the ability of primary epithelial cultures to engraft into damaged murine colon, suggesting promise for the application of the TGFB-induced regenerative circuit in cellular therapy.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523825v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147f3b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d1a64dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd0dc0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@91f7d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2023.01.13.523825"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.12.523842", "title": "Periosteal skeletal stem cells can migrate into the bone marrow and support hematopoiesis after injury", "authors": "Marchand, T.; Akinnola, K.

Both NHR-49 and its coactivator MDT-15 physically interact with the downstream components of IL-17 pathway, and their expression is significantly decreased when IL-17 signaling is enhanced.

Normal cell extrusion is typically unidirectional whereas bidirectional extrusion is often associated with disease (e.g. cancer). We describe two distinct mechanisms for MCC extrusion, a basal extrusion driven by Notch signaling and an apical extrusion driven by Piezo1. Early in the process there is a strong bias towards basal extrusion, but as development continues there is a shift towards apical extrusion. Importantly, receptivity to the Notch signal is age-dependent and governed by the maintenance of the MCC transcriptional program such that extension of this program is protective against cell loss. In contrast, later apical extrusion is regulated by Piezo 1 such that premature activation of Piezo 1 leads to early extrusion while blocking Piezo 1 leads to MCC maintenance. Distinct mechansms for MCC loss underlie the importance of their removal during epithelial remodeling.\n\nSummay StatementCell extrusion typically occurs unidirectionally.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are typically selected for inclusion if they pass a genome-wide significance threshold in order to guarantee that they are strong genetic instruments, but this also induces Winners curse, as SNP-exposure associations tend to be overestimated. In this paper, we consider how to combine SNP-exposure data from discovery and replication samples using two-sample and three-sample approaches to best account for Winners curse, weak instrument bias, and pleiotropy within a summary data MR framework, using only GWAS summary statistics. After reviewing several existing methods, that often correct for Winners curse at the individual SNP level, we propose a simple alternative based on the technique of regression calibration that enacts a global correction to the causal effect estimate directly. This approach does not only correct for Winners curse, but also simultaneously accounts for weak instruments bias. Regression calibration can be used with a wide range of existing MR methods, including pleiotropy-robust methods such as median-based and mode-based estimators. Extensive simulations and real data examples are used to illustrate the utility of the new approach. Software is provided for users to implement the method in practice.\n\nAuthor SummaryMendelian randomization is a method to explore causation in health research which exploits the random inheritance of genes from parents to offspring as a  natural experiment. It attempts to quantify the effect of intervening and modifying a health exposure, such as a persons body mass, on a downstream outcome such as blood pressure. Causal estimates obtained using this method can be strongly influenced by the set of genes used, or more specifically, the rationale used to select them. For example, selecting only genes that are strongly associated with the health exposure can induce bias due to the  Winners curse. Unfortunately, using genes with a small association can lead to so-called  weak instrument bias leading to a no-win paradox. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on the technique of regression calibration to de-bias causal estimates in an MR study. Our approach relies on the use of two independent samples for the exposure (discovery and replication) to estimate the amount of bias that is expected for a specific set of genes, so that causal estimates can be re-calibrated accordingly. We use extensive simulations and applied examples to compare our approach to current methods and provide software for researchers to implement our approach in future studies.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2023.01.12.523708"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.12.523654", "title": "Poison exon annotations improve the yield of clinically relevant variants in genomic diagnostic testing", "authors": "Felker, S.

Angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2) is localised to EC junctions and is required for alignment and actin reorganisation under conditions of high shear stress. Here we show that AmotL2 crucially regulates transcription and promotor activity of the YAP gene. Functionally, density-dependent proliferation of ECs in vitro and proliferation of a subpopulation of ECs within the inner aortic arch, were both reliant on AmotL2 and Yap/Taz endothelial expression in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of AmotL2 led to altered nuclear morphology, chromatin accessibility and suppression of YAP-promotor activity through increased H3K27me3 mediated by the polycromb repressive complex component EZH2.

Here, the metabolic profile of hMSCs was profiled during osteogenic differentiation over 14 days using a non-invasive live-cell imaging platform- two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2P-FLIM) which images and measures NADH fluorescence. During osteogenesis, we observe a higher dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for cellular energy; concomitant with an increased reliance on anabolic pathways. We validated this metabolic profile using qPCR and extracellular metabolite analysis and observed a higher reliance on glutaminolysis in the earlier time-points of osteogenic differentiation. Based on the results obtained, we sought to promote glutaminolysis further during osteogenic differentiation. An indirect method of promoting glutaminolysis was explored so as to not impact cellular differentiation. As Lactate has been shown to promote glutamine uptake via c-Myc activation triggering expression of glutamine transmembrane transporters and glutaminase 1; we chose to increase extracellular lactate concentrations to drive increased glutaminolysis rates leading to higher levels of mineral deposition and osteogenic gene expression. Lactate supplementation of osteogenic medium also promoted upregulation of lactate metabolism and increased the expression of transmembrane cellular lactate transporters. Higher rates of lactate dehydrogenase gene expression coupled with higher NADH fluorescence intensity demonstrate a conversion of lactate to pyruvate. During this conversion, NADH is formed by the reverse enzymatic reaction of lactate dehydrogenase resulting in increased NADH fluorescence intensity. In order to evaluate the importance of glutaminolysis and lactate metabolism in osteogenic differentiation, these metabolic pathways were shut down using BPTES and -CHC respectively which led to reduced hMSC mineralisation. In summary, we demonstrate that hMSCs osteogenic differentiation has a temporal metabolic profile and shift that is observed as early as day 3 of cell culture. Osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated to be directly dependent on OxPhos and on glutaminolysis and validated using biochemical assays. Furthermore, extracellular lactate is an essential metabolite to ensure osteogenic differentiation as a metabolic fuel and signalling molecule to promote glutaminolysis.

Many plants have evolved isoprene synthases (IspSs) with the capacity to liberate isoprene from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) as part of cellular protection mechanisms. Isoprene is hydrophobic and volatile, rapidly leaves plant tissues and is one of the main carbon emission sources from vegetation globally. The universality of isoprenoid metabolism allows volatile isoprene production from microbes expressing heterologous IspSs. Here, we compared heterologous overexpression from the nuclear genome and localization into the plastid of four plant terpene synthases (TPs) in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using sealed vial mixotrophic cultivation, direct quantification of isoprene production was achieved from the headspace of living cultures, with the highest isoprene production observed in algae expressing the Ipomoea batatas IspS. Perturbations of the downstream carotenoid pathway through keto carotenoid biosynthesis enhanced isoprene titers, which could be further enhanced by increasing flux towards DMAPP through heterologous co-expression of a yeast isopentenyl-PP delta isomerase. Multiplexed controlled-environment testing revealed that cultivation temperature, rather than illumination intensity, was the main factor affecting isoprene yield from the engineered alga. This is the first report of heterologous isoprene production from a eukaryotic alga and sets a foundation for further exploration of carbon conversion to this commodity chemical.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=72 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523746v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95085aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@575e72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9c2dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@67f252_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/13/2023.01.12.523746"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.12.523822", "title": "Z-Flipon Variants reveal the many roles of Z-DNA and Z-RNA in health and disease", "authors": "Umerenkov, D.; Herbert, A.; Konovalov, D.; Danilova, A.; Beknazarov, N.; Kokh, V.; Fedorov, A.; Poptsova, M.", "author_corresponding": "Alan Herbert", "author_corresponding_institution": "Insideoutbio.com", "date": "2023-01-13", "category": "genomics", "abstract": "Identifying roles for Z-flipons remains challenging given their dynamic nature.

The MACE approach offers a large-scale, densely packed silver (Ag) nanostructure on top of silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) with a large aspect ratio that significantly enhances the Raman signal due to localised surface plasmonic enhancement.

We discovered 115 protective gene knockouts, 82 of which are non-essential genes and 21 of which belong to the druggable genome. Notably, members of store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), very long-chain fatty acid synthesis, and SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) pathways provided marked protection against Ca2+ toxicity. These results reveal pathways previously unknown to mediate Ca2+-induced cell death and provide a resource for the development of pharmacotherapies against the sequelae of Ca2+ overload in disease.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/14/2023.01.13.523980"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.13.523977", "title": "Active compensation for changes in TDH3 expression mediated by direct regulators of TDH3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "authors": "Vande Zande, P.; Wittkopp, P.

The mechanisms of active compensation remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we investigate active compensation for the loss or reduction in expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TDH3 by its paralogs TDH1 and TDH2.

Such aneuploidies increase greatly as women age, originating from defective linkages between sister-chromatids (cohesion) in meiosis. We found evidence that loss of a specific pool of the cohesin protector protein, shugoshin 2 (Sgo2) contributes to this phenomenon. Our data indicate that Sgo2 preserves sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis by protecting a  cohesin bridge between sister chromatids. In human oocytes, Sgo2 localizes to both sub-centromere cups and the pericentromeric bridge which spans the sister chromatid junction. Sgo2 normally colocalizes with cohesin, however, in oocytes from older women, Sgo2 is frequently lost specifically from the pericentromeric bridge and sister chromatid cohesion is weakened. Mps1 and Bub1 kinase activities maintain Sgo2 at sub-centromeres and the pericentromeric bridge. Removal of Sgo2 throughout meiosis I by Mps1 inhibition reduces cohesion protection, increasing the incidence of single chromatids at meiosis II. Therefore, Sgo2 deficiency in human oocytes can exacerbate the effects of maternal age by rendering residual cohesin at pericentromeres vulnerable to loss in anaphase I. Our data show that maternal age-dependent loss of Sgo2 at the pericentromere bridge in human oocytes impairs cohesion integrity and contributes to the increased incidence of aneuploidy observed in human oocytes with advanced maternal age.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/14/2023.01.13.523952"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.13.523966", "title": "The effect of Dnaaf5 gene dosage on primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotypes", "authors": "Horani, A.; Gupta, D.

Recent efforts have identified key proteins and implicated cellular-scale mechanical properties, but how key proteins give rise to these larger-scale mechanical processes is unclear. Using force-sensitive biosensors, cell migration assays, and molecular clutch models, we sought a molecular understanding of adhesion strengthening that could bridge this gap. We found that the mechanical linker protein vinculin bears substantial loads at AJs, FAs, and in the cytoplasm during epithelial sheet migration, and we identified a switch-like residue on vinculin that regulates its conformation and loading at the AJs during CCM. In vinculin KO-rescue, this switch jointly controlled the speed and coupling length-scale of CCM, which suggested changes in adhesion-based friction. To test this, we developed molecularly detailed friction clutch models of the FA and AJ. They show that open, loaded vinculin increases friction in adhesive structures, with larger affects observed in AJs.

Collagen is the most abundant constituent of normal and fibrotic ECM in mammalian tissues. Its catabolism occurs through extracellular proteolysis and cell-mediated uptake of collagen fragments for intracellular degradation. Given the paucity of information regarding the regulation of this latter process, we executed unbiased genome-wide screens to understand the molecular underpinnings of cell-mediated collagen clearance. Using this approach, we discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism through which collagen biosynthesis is sensed by cells internally and directly regulates clearance of extracellular collagen. The sensing mechanism is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein SEL1L and occurs via a noncanonical function of SEL1L. This pathway functions as a homeostatic negative feedback loop that limits collagen accumulation in tissues. In human fibrotic lung disease, the induction of this collagen clearance pathway by collagen synthesis is impaired, thereby contributing to the pathological accumulation of collagen in lung tissue.

However, cryo-EM structures of DDA complexes have not resolve these regions of the IC and p150Glued, raising questions about the importance of this interaction. The IC N-terminus (ICN) also interacts with the dynein regulators Nde1/Ndel1, which compete with p150Glued for binding to ICN. Using a combination of approaches, we reveal that the ICN plays critical, evolutionarily conserved roles in DDA assembly by interacting with dynactin and Ndel1, the latter of which recruits the DDA assembly factor LIS1 to the dynein complex. In contrast to prior models, we find that LIS1 cannot simultaneously bind to Ndel1 and dynein, indicating that LIS1 must be handed off from Ndel1 to dynein in temporally discrete steps. Whereas exogenous Ndel1 or p150Glued disrupts DDA complex assembly in vitro, neither perturbs preassembled DDA complexes, indicating that the IC is stably bound to p150Glued within activated DDA complexes.

Using a bioassay methodology designed to maximise the phenotypic difference between resistant and susceptible samples, we sequenced 969 phenotyped female An. gambiae and An. coluzzii from ten locations across four countries in West Africa (Benin, Cote dIvoire, Ghana and Togo), identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) segregating in the populations. The patterns of resistance association were highly multiallelic and variable between populations, with different genomic regions contributing to resistance, as well as different mutations within a given region. While the strongest and most consistent association with deltamethrin resistance came from the region around Cyp6aa1, this resistance was based on a combination of several independent CNVs in An. coluzzii, and on a non-CNV bearing haplotype in An. gambiae. Further signals involved a range of cytochrome P450, mitochondrial, and immunity genes. Similarly, for pirimiphos-methyl, while the strongest signal came from the region of Ace1, more widespread signals included cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and a subunit of the nAChR target site of neonicotinoid insecticides. The regions around Cyp9k1 and the Tep family of immune genes were associated with resistance to both insecticide classes, suggesting possible cross-resistance mechanisms.

Here we bridge this gap by introducing Automated Pairwise Peptide-Receptor AnalysIs for Screening Engineered proteins (APPRAISE), a method for predicting the receptor binding propensity of engineered proteins. After generating models of engineered proteins competing for binding to a target using an established structure-prediction tool such as AlphaFold2-multimer or ESMFold, APPRAISE performs a rapid (under 1 CPU second per model) scoring analysis that takes into account biophysical and geometrical constraints. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that APPRAISE can accurately classify receptor-dependent vs. receptor-independent engineered adeno-associated viral vectors, as well as diverse classes of engineered proteins such as miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nanobodies targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor, and peptides that specifically bind to transferrin receptor and PD-L1.

To demonstrate this, we present EMERALD, a dedicated command line tool able to infer alignment-safe sequence intervals from biodiverse protein sequence clusters. EMERALD effectively explores suboptimal alignment paths within the pairwise dynamic programming matrix and flags robust intervals that are shared across all suboptimal configurations.

Using publicly available NGS data, we assembled 40 Cape buffalo mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from four protected areas in South Africa, expanding the geographical range and almost doubling the number of mitogenomes available for this species. Coverage of the mitogenomes ranged from 154-1,036X. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity for Kruger National Park (n = 15) and Mokala National Park (n = 5) were similar to diversity levels in southern and eastern Africa. Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 15) had low levels of genetic diversity, with only four haplotypes detected, reflecting its past bottleneck. Addo Elephant National Park (n = 5) had the highest nucleotide diversity of all populations across Africa, which was unexpected, as it is known from previous studies to have low nuclear diversity. This diversity was driven by a highly divergent mitogenome from one sample, which was also identified in another sample via Sanger sequencing of cytochrome b. Using a fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis, we estimated that this mitogenome diverged from all other Cape buffalo approximately 2.15 million years ago.

In comparison to mature GCs (mGCs) (born during development), the imGCs exhibit two competing distinct properties such as high excitability and low excitatory innervation. We develop a spiking neural network for the DG, incorporating the imGCs, and investigate their effect on pattern separation (i.e., a process of transforming similar input patterns into less similar output patterns). We first consider the effect of high excitability. The imGCs become very highly active due to their low firing threshold. Then, because of high activation, strong pattern correlation occurs, which results in pattern integration (i.e., making association between events). On the other hand, the mGCs exhibit very sparse firing activity due to strongly increased feedback inhibition (caused by the high activation of the imGCs). As a result of high sparsity, the pattern separation efficacy (PSE) of the mGCs becomes very high. Thus, the whole population of GCs becomes a heterogeneous one, composed of a (major) subpopulation of mGCs (i.e., pattern separators) with very low activation degree [Formula] and a (minor) subpopulation of imGCs (i.e., pattern integrators) with very high activation degree [Formula]. In the whole heterogeneous population, the overall activation degree [Formula] of all the GCs is a little reduced in comparison to the activation degree [Formula] in the presence of only mGCs without imGCs. However, no pattern separation occurs, due to heterogeneous sparsity, in contrast to the usual intuitive thought that sparsity could improve PSE. Next, we consider the effect of low excitatory innervation for the imGCs, counteracting the effect of their high excitability. With decreasing the connection probability of excitatory inputs to the imGCs, [Formula] decreases so rapidly, and their effect becomes weaker. Then, the feedback inhibition to the mGCs is also decreased, leading to increase in [Formula] of the mGCs. Accordingly, [Formula] of the whole GCs also increases. In this case of low excitatory connectivity, the imGCs perform pattern integration. On the other hand, due to increase in [Formula], the PSE of the mGCs decreases from a high value to a limit value. In the whole population of all the GCs, when the excitatory connection probability decreases through a threshold, pattern separation starts, the overall PSE increases and approaches that of the mGCs. However, due to heterogeneity caused by the imGCs, the overall PSE becomes deteriorated, in comparison with that in the presence of only mGCs.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/15/2023.01.12.523852"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.11.523651", "title": "Predicting the functional effect of compound heterozygous genotypes from large scale variant effect maps", "authors": "Xie, M.

As a result, there are massive gaps in our understanding of genes and molecular mechanisms that underlie sex- and age-associated physiology and disease. Hundreds of thousands of publicly-available human transcriptomes capturing gene expression profiles of tissues across the body and subject to various biomedical and clinical factors present an invaluable, yet untapped, opportunity for bridging these gaps. Here, we present a computational framework that leverages these data to infer genome-wide molecular signatures specific to sex and age groups. As the vast majority of these profiles lack age and sex labels, the core idea of our framework is to use the measured expression data to predict missing age/sex metadata and derive the signatures from the predictive models. We first curated [~]30,000 primary samples associated with age and sex information and profiled using microarray and RNA-seq. Then, we used this dataset to infer sex-biased genes within eleven age groups along the human lifespan and then trained machine learning (ML) models to predict these age groups from gene expression values separately within females and males. Specifically, we trained one-vs-rest logistic regression classifiers with elastic-net regularization to classify transcriptomes into age groups. Dataset-level cross validation shows that these ML classifiers are able to discriminate between age groups in a biologically meaningful way in each sex across technologies. Further, these predictive models capture sex-stratified age-group  gene signatures, i.e., the strength and the direction of importance of genes across the genome for each age group in each sex. Enrichment analysis of these gene signatures with prior gene annotations helped in identifying age- and sex-associated multi-tissue and pan-body molecular phenomena (e.g., general immune response, inflammation, metabolism, hormone response).

Kinetic proofreading enhances the difference in the mean receptor occupancy between different ligands, thus potentially enabling better discrimination. On the other hand, proofreading also attenuates the signal, increasing the relative magnitude of noise in the downstream signal. This can interfere with reliable ligand discrimination. To understand the effect of noise on ligand discrimination beyond the comparison of the mean signals, we formulate the task of ligand discrimination as a problem of statistical estimation of the molecular affinity of ligands. Our analysis reveals that proofreading typically worsens ligand resolution which decreases with the number of proofreading steps under most commonly considered conditions. This contrasts with the usual notion that kinetic proofreading universally improves ligand discrimination with additional proofreading steps. Our results are consistent across a variety of different proofreading schemes, suggesting that they are inherent to the KPR mechanism itself rather than any particular model of molecular noise.

Careful selection of fluorescent labels (FLs) is crucial for successful HCS assay development. HCS assays typically comprise (1) FLs containing biological information of interest, and (2) additional structural FLs enabling instance segmentation for downstream analysis. However, the limited number of available fluorescence microscopy imaging channels restricts the degree to which these FLs can be experimentally multiplexed. In this paper, we present a segmentation workflow that overcomes the dependency on structural FLs for image segmentation, typically freeing 2 fluorescence microscopy channels for biologically relevant FLs. It consists in extracting structural information encoded within readouts that are primarily biological, by fine-tuning pre-trained state-of-the-art generalist cell segmentation models for different combinations of individual FLs, and aggregating the respective segmentation results together. Using annotated datasets that we provide, we confirm our methodology offers improvements in performance and robustness across several segmentation aggregation strategies and image acquisition methods, over different cell lines and various FLs. It thus enables the biological information content of HCS assays to be maximized without compromising the robustness and accuracy of computational single-cell profiling.\n\nImpact StatementThis methodological paper describes a framework enabling cell segmentation for datasets without structural fluorescent labels to highlight cell organelles.

Although several deep learning methods for immune repertoire analysis are introduced, they consider the immune repertoire as a set-like structure that doesnt take into account the nature of the immune response. When the immune response occurs, mutations are introduced to the immune receptor sequence sequentially to optimize the immune response against the pathogens that enter our body.

Further the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) analysis were also carriedout using QIKPRO programme.\n\nResultsThe results revealed that, the twelve phytocompounds of P.betle showed GLIDE XP docking score (-6.881 to - 4.766 Kcal/mol) higher than allopurinol (-4.535 Kcal/mol) and 11 phytocompounds showed higher GLIDE energy (-42.822 Kcal/mol to - 36.706 Kcal/mol) than allopurinol (-32.676 Kcal/mol). Chromonol and eugenol were the most potential compounds of P.betle which showed both hydrogen bond and Pi-Pi interactions with the target xanthine oxidase as that of standard drug allopurinol. The selected phytocompounds satisfied the ADME descriptors and have no violation of Lipinskis rule of five.\n\nConclusionsThe insilico and ADMET profile study on the phytocompounds of P.betle predicted their promising potential xanthine oxidase inhibition activity and they could be developed as alternate molecules against synthetic agents by invivo experiments for the treatment of xanthine oxidase associated diseases like hyperuricimia and cardiovascular disorders.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/16/2023.01.13.523909"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.12.523725", "title": "MaGplotR: a software for the analysis and visualization of multiple MaGeCK screen datasets through aggregation", "authors": "Matia, A.; Lorenzo, M.

Since cerebral white matter injury is the major form of brain impairment in survivors of premature birth, the identification of reliable, non-invasive markers of altered white matter development is of utmost importance in diagnostics. Diffusion MRI has recently emerged as a valuable tool to investigate these kinds of alterations. In this work, rather than focusing on a single MRI modality, we worked on a compound of beyond-DTI High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) techniques in a group of 46 preterm babies studied on a 3T scanner at term equivalent age and in 23 control neonates born at term. After extracting relevant derived parameters, we examined discriminative patterns of preterm birth through (i) a traditional voxel-wise statistical method such as the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics approach (TBSS); (ii) an advanced Machine Learning approach such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification; (iii) establishing the degree of association between the two methods in voting white matter most discriminating areas. Finally, we applied a multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in search for sources of linked alterations across modalities. TBSS analysis showed significant differences between preterm and term cohorts in several white matter areas for multiple HARDI features. SVM classification performed on skeletonized HARDI measures produced satisfactory accuracy rates, especially as for highly informative parameters about fibers directionality. Assessment of the degree of overlap between the relevant measures identified by the two methods exhibited a good, though parameter-dependent rate of agreement. Finally, CCA analysis identified joint changes precisely for those features exhibiting less correspondence between TBSS and SVM.

We show that the sites captured and the coverage of key CpGs required for age prediction vary greatly between datasets, which likely contributes to the lack of transferability in RRBS clocks. To mitigate these coverage issues in RRBS-based age prediction, we present two novel design strategies that use average methylation over large regions rather than individual CpGs, whereby regions are defined by sliding windows (e.g. 5 kb), or density-based clustering of CpGs. We observe improved correlation and error in our regional blood clocks (RegBCs) compared to published individual-CpG-based techniques when applied to external datasets. The RegBCs are also more robust when applied to low coverage data and detect a negative age acceleration in mice undergoing calorie restriction.

Multiomics systems biology analysis can shed new light on PAH pathobiology and inform translational research efforts. Using RNA sequencing on the largest PAH lung biobank to date (96 disease and 52 control), we aim to identify gene co-expression network modules associated with PAH and potential therapeutic targets. Co-expression network analysis was performed to identify modules of co-expressed genes which were then assessed for and prioritized by importance in PAH, regulatory role, and therapeutic potential via integration with clinicopathologic data, human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PAH, lung Bayesian regulatory networks, single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and pharmacotranscriptomic profiles. We identified a co-expression module of 266 genes, called the pink module, which may be a response to the underlying disease process to counteract disease progression in PAH. This module was associated not only with PAH severity such as increased PVR and intimal thickness, but also with compensated PAH such as lower number of hospitalizations, WHO functional class and NT-proBNP. GWAS integration demonstrated the pink module is enriched for PAH-associated genetic variation in multiple cohorts. Regulatory network analysis revealed that BMPR2 regulates the main target of FDA-approved riociguat, GUCY1A2, in the pink module. Analysis of pathway enrichment and pink hub genes (i.e. ANTXR1 and SFRP4) suggests the pink module inhibits Wnt signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Cell type deconvolution showed the pink module correlates with higher vascular cell fractions (i.e. myofibroblasts). A pharmacotranscriptomic screen discovered ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) as potential therapeutic targets to mimic the pink module signature.

Using micro-CT staged patient tissues, we characterized the appearance and interaction of myofibroblasts, an ectopic endothelial cell state and basaloid epithelial cells in the thickened alveolar septum of early-stage lung fibrosis. Induction of these states in the ex vivo hPCLS model provides evidence that the basaloid cell state was derived from alveolar type-2 cells, whereas the ectopic endothelial cell state emerged from capillary cell plasticity.

Using Notch-dependent transcriptional activation as a direct readout of GSC-DTC/niche interaction and its transcriptional activity as a readout for GSC function, we find that an age-dependent reduction in Notch transcription occurs both at the tissue and the cellular levels, but with its activity at the chromosomal loci remains unaffected. This overall reduction is due to an age-dependent progressive shift in the spatial pattern of Notch-dependent transcription in the germline, resulting in a shift of the GSC pool location and disruption of the tissue integrity. We show that the position of the DTC/niche nucleus determines the location of the Notch-responsive GSC pool, with its correlation to the structure and morphology of the DTC/niche, which also changes during aging.

Here we found that LBR likely facilitates PER foci accumulation by destabilizing the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, MICROTUBULE STAR (MTS). MTS is known to dephosphorylate PER and hampers the accumulation of PER foci. On the other hand, the circadian kinase DOUBLETIME (DBT) which phosphorylates PER enhances the accumulation of the foci. These foci are likely phase-separated condensates, the formation of which mediated by intrinsically disordered region in PER. Taken together, here we demonstrate a key role for phosphorylation in promoting the accumulation of PER foci, while LBR modulates this process by impinging on the circadian phosphatase MTS.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/16/2023.01.16.524233"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.16.524206", "title": "Mechanical forces in extendable tissue matrix orient cell divisions via microtubule stabilization in Arabidopsis", "authors": "Hoermayer, L.; Montesinos, J.

We revealed that root tissue functions as interconnected cell matrix with a radial gradient of tissue extendibility causing a predictable tissue deformation after wounding.

Microtubules are destabilized under low tension, whereas stretching of cells, either through wounding or external aspiration immediately induce their polymerisation.

South China is an ethnolinguistically diverse region and indigenously settled by ethnolinguistically diverse HM, Austroasiatic (AA), Tai-Kadai (TK), Austronesian (AN), and Sino-Tibetan (ST) people, which is regarded as East Asias initial cradle of biodiversity. However, previous fragmented genetic studies have only presented a fraction of the landscape of genetic diversity in this region, especially the lack of haplotype-based genomic resources. The deep characterization of demographic history and natural-selection-relevant architecture in HM people was necessary.\n\nResultsWe comprehensively reported the population-specific genomic resources and explored the fine-scale genetic structure and adaptative features inferred from the high-density SNP data in 440 individuals from 34 ethnolinguistic populations, including previously unreported She. We identified solid genetic differentiation between inland (Miao/Yao) and coastal (She) southern Chinese HM people, and the latter obtained more gene flow from northern East Asians. Multiple admixture models further confirmed that extensive gene flow from surrounding ST, TK, and AN people entangled in forming the gene pool of coastal southeastern East Asian HM people. Population genetic findings of isolated shared unique ancestral components based on the sharing alleles and haplotypes deconstructed that HM people from Yungui Plateau carried the breadth of genomic diversity and previously unknown genetic features. We identified a direct and recent genetic connection between Chinese and Southeast Asian HM people as they shared the most extended IBD fragments, supporting the long-distance migration hypothesis. Uniparental phylogenetic topology and Network relationship reconstruction found ancient uniparental lineages in southwestern HM people. Finally, the population-specific biological adaptation study identified the shared and differentiated natural-selection signatures among inland and coastal HM people associated with physical features and immune function. The allele frequency spectrum (AFS) of clinical cancer susceptibility alleles and pharmacogenomic genes showed significant differences between HM and northern Chinese people.\n\nConclusionsOur extensive genetic evidence combined with the historic documents supported the view that ancient HM people originated in Yungui regions associated with ancient  Three-Miao tribes descended from the ancient Daxi-Qujialing-Shijiahe people. And then, some recently rapidly migrated to Southeast Asia, and some culturally dispersed eastward and mixed respectively with Southeast Asian indigenes, coastal Liangzhu-related ancient populations, and incoming southward Sino-Tibetan people. Generally, complex population migration, admixture, and adaptation history contributed to their specific patterns of non-coding or disease-related genetic variations.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2023.01.14.523079"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.14.524055", "title": "Genomic resources enable insight into the developmental transcriptome of the blastoclad fungus, Coelomomyces lativittatus, an obligate parasite of mosquitoes and microcrustaceans", "authors": "Ettinger, C.

Single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a powerful technique for interrogating single-cell chromatin-based gene regulation, and genes or gene sets with dynamic regulatory potentials can be regarded as cell-type specific markers as if in scRNA-seq. However, there are few GSS tools specifically designed for scATAC-seq, and the applicability and performance of RNA-seq GSS tools on scATAC-seq data remain to be investigated. We systematically benchmarked ten GSS tools, including four bulk RNA-seq tools, five single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) tools, and one scATAC-seq method. First, using matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets, we find that the performance of GSS tools on scATAC-seq data is comparable to that on scRNA-seq, suggesting their applicability to scATAC-seq. Then the performance of different GSS tools were extensively evaluated using up to ten scATAC-seq datasets. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of gene activity conversion, dropout imputation, and gene set collections on the results of GSS.

The complement peptide C5a, generated during the activation of complement cascade, is a potent inflammatory molecule, and increased levels of C5a are implicated in multiple inflammatory disorders including the advanced stages of COVID-19 pathophysiology. The proximal step in C5a-mediated cellular and physiological responses is its interaction with two different seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) known as C5aR1 and C5aR2. Despite a large body of functional data on C5a-C5aR1 interaction, direct visualization of their interaction at high-resolution is still lacking, and it represents a significant knowledge gap in our current understanding of complement receptor activation and signaling. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of C5aR1 activated by its natural agonist C5a, and a G-protein-biased synthetic peptide ligand C5apep, in complex with heterotrimeric G-proteins. The C5a-C5aR1 structure reveals the ligand binding interface involving the N-terminus and extracellular loops of the receptor, and we observe that C5a exhibits a significant conformational change upon its interaction with the receptor compared to the basal conformation. On the other hand, the structural details of C5apep-C5aR1 complex provide a molecular basis to rationalize the ability of peptides, designed based on the carboxyl-terminus sequence of C5a, to act as potent agonists of the receptor, and also the mechanism underlying their biased agonism. In addition, these structural snapshots also reveal activation-associated conformational changes in C5aR1 including outward movement of TM6 and a dramatic rotation of helix 8, and the interaction interface for G-protein-coupling.

In contrast, constitutive artificial neural networks enable automated model discovery without having to choosing a specific model a priori before learning the model parameters. Here we reverse engineer a constitutive artificial neural network that uses the principal stretches, raised to a wide range of exponential powers, as activation functions for the hidden layer. Upon training, the network autonomously discovers a subclass of models with multiple Ogden terms that outperform popular constitutive models including neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, and Mooney Rivlin.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are most often repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Alterations in repair pathways can indicate sensitivity to therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors, cisplatin, and immunotherapy. Thus, functional assays to measure rates of HR and NHEJ are of significant interest. Several methods have been developed to measure rates of HR or NHEJ; however, there is a need for functional cell-based assays that can measure rates by both major DNA DSB pathways simultaneously. Here, we describe the RepairSwitch assay, a flow cytometry assay to assess rates of HR and NHEJ mediated repair of Cas9 programmed DSB simultaneously using a novel fluorescence switching reporter system. The assay exhibits low background signal and is capable of detecting rare repair events in the 1 in 10,000 range. We demonstrate the utility of RepairSwitch by measuring the potency of inhibitors of ATM (KU-60019, KU-55933), DNA-PK (NU7441), and PARP (Olaparib) on modulating DSB repair rates in HEK293FT cells. The selective ATM inhibitor KU-60019 inhibited HR rates with IC50 of 915 nM. Interestingly, KU-60019 exposure led to a dose responsive increase in rates of NHEJ. In contrast, the less selective ATM inhibitor KU-55933, which also has activity on DNA-PK, showed inhibition of both HR and NHEJ. The selective DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 inhibited NHEJ efficiency with an IC50 of 299 nM, and showed a dose responsive increase in HR. The PARP inhibitor Olaparib showed lower potency in modulating HR and NHEJ. We next used the RepairSwitch assay to assess how pharmacological and genetic inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) impacted rates of HR and NHEJ. The DNMT inhibitor decitabine reduced HR, but increased rates of NHEJ, both in a dose responsive manner, in both HEK293FT and HCT116 cells (IC50 for HR of 187 nM and 1.4 uM respectively). Knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B increased NHEJ, while knockout of DNMT3B, but not DNMT1, reduced HR. These results illustrate the utility of RepairSwitch as a functional assay for measuring changes in rates of DSB repair induced by pharmacological or genetic perturbation. Furthermore, the findings illustrate the potential for one DNA repair mechanism to compensate in part for loss of another. Finally, we showed that inhibition of DNMT can lead to reduction of HR and increase in NHEJ, providing some additional insight into recently observed synergy of DNMT inhibitors with PARP inhibitors for cancer treatment.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2023.01.17.524235"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.17.524354", "title": "Microtubule-associated proteins MAP7 and MAP7D1 promote DNA double strand break repair in the G1 cell cycle phase.", "authors": "Dullovi, A.; Ozgencil, M.; Tse, W.

Expression of these enzymes is frequently observed in advanced-stage cancers and is associated with poor disease prognosis and immune suppression. Mechanistically, the respective roles of tryptophan shortage and kynurenine production in suppressing immunity remain unclear. Kynurenine was proposed as an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which can regulate inflammation and immunity. However, controversy remains regarding the role of AHR in IDO1/TDO-mediated immune suppression, as well as the involvement of kynurenine. In this study, we aimed to clarify the link between IDO1/TDO expression, AHR pathway activation and immune suppression.\n\nMethodsAHR expression and activation was analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis in cells engineered to express IDO1/TDO, or cultured in medium mimicking tryptophan catabolism by IDO1/TDO. In vitro differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) was compared in T cells isolated from mice bearing different Ahr alleles or a knockout of Ahr, and cultured in medium with or without tryptophan and kynurenine.\n\nResultsWe confirmed that IDO1/TDO expression activated AHR in HEK-293-E cells, as measured by the induction of AHR target genes. Unexpectedly, AHR was also overexpressed upon IDO1/TDO expression. AHR overexpression did not depend on kynurenine but was triggered by tryptophan deprivation. Multiple human tumor cell lines overexpressed AHR upon tryptophan deprivation. AHR overexpression was not dependent on GCN2, and strongly sensitized the AHR pathway. As a result, kynurenine and other tryptophan catabolites, which are weak AHR agonists in normal conditions, strongly induced AHR target genes in tryptophan-depleted conditions. Tryptophan depletion also increased kynurenine uptake by increasing SLC7A5 (LAT1) expression in a GCN2-dependent manner. Tryptophan deprivation potentiated Treg differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells isolated from mice bearing an AHR allele of weak affinity similar to the human AHR.\n\nConclusionsTryptophan deprivation sensitizes the AHR pathway by inducing AHR overexpression and increasing cellular kynurenine uptake. As a result, tryptophan catabolites such as kynurenine, more potently activate AHR, and Treg differentiation is promoted. Our results propose a molecular explanation for the combined roles of tryptophan deprivation and kynurenine production in mediating IDO1/TDO-induced immune suppression.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIn preclinical models, tryptophan degradation by IDO1 or TDO was shown to induce tumoral resistance to immune rejection, by restricting inflammation and promoting T-cell tolerance to immunogenic tumor antigens. However, the mechanism that translates these metabolic changes into T-lymphocyte malfunction within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still uncertain. It has been proposed that kynurenine, the main tryptophan catabolite, acts as an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), leading to the suggestion that the IDO1/Kyn/AHR axis could play a key role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses. However, recent studies challenged the notion that kynurenine is a genuine and potent AHR agonistic ligand. Moreover, the relative role of tryptophan depletion versus kynurenine production in IDO1/TDO mediated immune suppression remains unknown.\n\nIn this work, we further explored and clarified the association between IDO1/TDO activity and AHR activation. Unexpectedly, we observed that tryptophan depletion strongly increased AHR expression, thereby potentiating its activation by weak agonists such as kynurenine and derivatives. Tryptophan depletion thereby potentiated the induction of regulatory T cells. This was particularly true in mouse strains that express an Ahr allele of weak affinity, similar to the human AHR.\n\nTryptophan depletion also increased cellular kynurenine uptake by increasing SLC7A5 (LAT1) expression in a GCN2-dependent manner, thereby also contributing to a better AHR activation by kynurenine upon tryptophan depletion.\n\nAltogether, our findings identify a new mechanism explaining IDO/TDO mediated AHR activation and immune suppression, based on the sensitization of the AHR pathway by tryptophan depletion, resulting in a higher AHR stimulation by weak agonists of the kynurenine pathway, and a better induction of regulatory T cells.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/17/2023.01.16.524177"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.16.523994", "title": "Natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants in K18-ACE2 mice gives rise to more virulent virus and variant alleles associated with treatment resistance.", "authors": "Willett, J.

Here, we systematically monitor how secondary structure modulates ADAR2 vs ADAR1 substrate selectivity, on the basis of systematic probing of thousands of synthetic sequences transfected into ADAR1-deleted cell lines exogenously expressing either ADAR2 or ADAR1. In both cases, structural disruptions gave rise to symmetric, strand-specific induced editing at a fixed offset, but of varying length: -26 nt for ADAR2, and -35 nt for ADAR1. We dissect the basis for the differences in offset between ADAR1 and ADAR2 via diverse mutants, domain-swaps, and ADAR evolutionary homologs, and reveal that it is encoded by the differential RNA binding domain architecture. We demonstrate that this offset-enhanced editing can allow an improved design of ADAR2-recruiting therapeutics, with proof-of-concept experiments suggestive of increased on-target and potentially decreased off-target editing.

Previous high-throughput screening efforts identified the small molecule AA147 as a potent and selective ATF6 activating compound that operates through a mechanism involving metabolic activation of its 2-amino-p-cresol substructure affording a quinone methide, which then covalently modifies a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). Intriguingly, another compound identified in this screen, AA132, also contains a 2-amino-p-cresol moiety; however, this compound showed less transcriptional selectivity, instead globally activating all three arms of the UPR. Here, we show that AA132 activates global UPR signaling through a mechanism analogous to that of AA147, involving metabolic activation and covalent PDI modification. Chemoproteomic-enabled analyses show that AA132 covalently modifies PDIs to a greater extent than AA147. Paradoxically, activated AA132 reacts slower with PDIs, indicating it is less reactive than activated AA147. This suggests that the higher labeling of PDIs observed with activated AA132 can be attributed to its lower reactivity, which allows this activated compound to persist longer in the cellular environment prior to quenching by endogenous nucleophiles. Collectively, these results suggest that AA132 globally activates the UPR through increased engagement of ER PDIs. Consistent with this, reducing the cellular concentration of AA132 decreases PDI modifications and allows for selective ATF6 activation.

While biosynthetic routes to diverse aldehydes have been designed, a common challenge is the stability of these aldehydes in the presence of microbial hosts of engineered pathways. Here, we identify and address unexpected oxidation of a model collection of aromatic aldehydes, including many that originate from biomass degradation, in the presence of Escherichia coli strains that were engineered to minimize aldehyde reduction. Of heightened interest to us were resting cell conditions as they offer numerous advantages for the bioconversion of toxic metabolites. Surprisingly, when diverse aldehydes are supplemented to E. coli RARE cells grown under aerobic conditions, they remain stabilized on the timescale of days, whereas when these same aldehydes are supplemented to resting cell preparations of E. coli RARE that had been grown under the same conditions, we observe substantial oxidation. By performing combinatorial inactivation of six candidate aldehyde dehydrogenase genes in the E. coli genome using multiplexed automatable genome engineering (MAGE), we demonstrate that this oxidation can be substantially slowed, with greater than 50% retention of 6 out of 8 aldehydes when assayed 4 hours after their addition. Given that our newly engineered strain exhibits Reduced Oxidation And Reduction of aromatic aldehydes, we dubbed it the E. coli ROAR strain. Seeking to apply this new strain to resting cell biocatalysis, we compared the capability to synthesis the aldehyde furfural from 2-furoic acid via the carboxylic acid reductase enzyme from Nocardia iowensis.

Small molecule inhibitors of the splicing factor SF3B1 cause loss of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb from protein-coding gene templates and major transcription defects, indicating that splicing can, in turn, positively affect transcription. To understand better the relationship between pre-mRNA splicing and pol II transcription, we have investigated the effect of two other splicing inhibitors, Madrasin and Isoginkgetin, on transcription. We found that Madrasin rapidly inhibits pre-mRNA splicing, whereas Isoginkgetin affects transcription before any detectable effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, we found that both of these small molecules promote general downregulation of transcription and global transcriptional readthrough, including on intronless and histone genes. Both small molecules affect the association of the mRNA CPA complex with chromatin, likely explaining the transcription termination defect.

Rapid decapping of unstable mRNAs, for example, allows little time for deadenylation, which explains their longer than average poly(A) tails.

We trace this radical, large-scale conformational change at the atomic level with unbiased, replica exchange, and umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. We decipher how GTP loading from the GTPase domain to the distal stalk end is mediated by an allosteric network of salt bridges that act in response to GTP binding and subsequent conformational changes in GTPase domain motifs.

This cortex stiffens the cell surface and thus opposes cellular deformation, yet also actively generates membrane protrusions by exerting polymerization forces. It is unclear how the interplay between these two opposing mechanical functions plays out to shape the cell surface. To answer this question, we reconstitute biomimetic actin cortices nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex inside cell-sized lipid vesicles. We show that thin Arp2/3-nucleated actin cortices strongly deform and rigidify the shapes of giant unilamellar vesicles and impart a shape memory on time scales that exceeds the time of actin turnover. In addition, actin cortices can produce finger-like membrane protrusions, showing that Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization forces alone are sufficient to initiate protrusions in the absence of actin bundling or membrane curving proteins. Combining mathematical modeling and our experimental results reveals that the concentration of actin nucleating proteins, rather than actin polymerization speed, is crucial for protrusion formation. This is because locally concentrated actin polymerization forces can drive a positive feedback loop between recruitment of actin and its nucleators to drive membrane deformation. Our work paints a picture where the actin cortex can either drive or inhibit deformations depending on the local distribution of nucleators.\n\nSignificance StatementThe cells in our body must actively change shape in order to migrate, grow and divide, but they also need to maintain their shape to withstand external forces during tissue development. Cellular shape control results from an interplay between the plasma membrane and its underlying cortex, a shell composed of crosslinked actin filaments. Using cell-free reconstitution and mathematical modelling, we show that minimal biomimetic actin cortices can mechanically rigidify lipid vesicles while at the same time driving membrane protrusion formation. Our observations suggest that the spatial distribution of actin nucleation determines whether the actin cortex drives or inhibits membrane deformations.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.15.524117"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.16.524303", "title": "Experimental Tests of the Virtual Circular Genome Model for Non-enzymatic RNA Replication", "authors": "Ding, D.; Zhou, L.; Mittal, S.; Szostak, J.

Replication is driven by templated nonenzymatic primer extension on a subset of kinetically trapped partially base-paired configurations, followed by shuffling of these configurations to enable continued oligonucleotide elongation. Here we describe initial experimental studies of the feasibility of the VCG model for replication. We designed a small 12-nucleotide model VCG and synthesized all 247 oligonucleotides of length 2 to 12 corresponding to this genome. We experimentally monitored the fate of individual labeled primers in the pool of VCG oligonucleotides following the addition of activated nucleotides, and investigated factors such as oligonucleotide length, concentration, composition, and temperature on the extent of primer extension. We observe a surprisingly prolonged equilibration process in the VCG system that enables a considerable extent of reaction. We find that environmental fluctuations would be essential for continuous templated extension of the entire VCG system, since the shortest oligonucleotides can only bind to templates at low temperatures, while the longest oligonucleotides require high temperature spikes to escape from inactive configurations.

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.\n\n\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@306d78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@162e88forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@920b26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1937org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d991e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_TABLECAPTIONGlossary\n\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.17.524456"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.15.524116", "title": "Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases 1 and 2 regulate a protective liver response to a high-fat diet", "authors": "Iuso, D.; Garcia-Saez, I.; Coute, Y.; Yamaryo-Botte, Y.; Erba, E.

We test this hypothesis by measuring Ulva biomass and internal nitrogen in offshore experiments in the nitrogen-poor EMS a few kilometers offshore the Israeli coast. We construct a predictive cultivation model to estimate N concentrations in the sea during experiments. This study demonstrates the feasibility of growing Ulva sp. offshore the EMS with an onshore nutrient supply and develops a better understanding of seasonal growth dynamics and environmental effects (nitrogen, waves, depth, etc.). Furthermore, the study showcases the applicability of the macroalgae cultivation model in the offshore environment and its potential contribution throughout the whole lifecycle of seaweed cultivation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.15.524102"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.15.524128", "title": "Deep Learning Dynamic Allostery of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors", "authors": "Do, H.

Allosteric modulators have emerged as more selective drug candidates compared with orthosteric agonists and antagonists. However, many X-ray and cryo-EM structures of GPCRs resolved so far exhibit negligible differences upon binding of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs). Mechanism of dynamic allosteric modulation in GPCRs remains unclear. In this work, we have systematically mapped dynamic changes in free energy landscapes of GPCRs upon binding of allosteric modulators using the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), Deep Learning (DL) and free energy prOfiling Workflow (GLOW). A total of 18 available high-resolution experimental structures of allosteric modulator-bound class A and B GPCRs were collected for simulations. A number of 8 computational models were generated to examine selectivity of the modulators by changing their target receptors to different subtypes. All-atom GaMD simulations were performed for a total of 66 {micro}s on 44 GPCR systems in the presence/absence of the modulator. DL and free energy calculations revealed significantly reduced conformational space of GPCRs upon modulator binding. While the modulator-free GPCRs often sampled multiple low-energy conformational states, the NAMs and PAMs confined the inactive and active agonist-G protein-bound GPCRs, respectively, to mostly only one specific conformation for signaling. Such cooperative effects were significantly reduced for binding of the selective modulators to \"non-cognate\" receptor subtypes in the computational models. Therefore, comprehensive DL of extensive GaMD simulations has revealed a general dynamic mechanism of GPCR allostery, which will greatly facilitate rational design of selective allosteric drugs of GPCRs.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.15.524128"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.15.524135", "title": "AnnoSpat annotates cell types and quantifies cellular arrangements from spatial proteomics", "authors": "Mongia, A.; Saunders, D.; Wang, Y.; Brissova, M.; Powers, A.

Evolution of these mechanisms depends on whether traits are genetically complex (involving many genes) and how gene expression that impact the traits is converted to phenotype. Yet, genomic mechanisms that impact physiological traits are diverse and context dependent (e.g., vary by environment or among tissues), making them difficult to discern. Here we examine the relationships between genotype, mRNA expression, and physiological traits to discern the genetic complexity and whether the gene expression effecting the physiological traits is primarily cis or trans-acting. We use low-coverage whole genome sequencing and tissue specific mRNA expression among individuals to identify polymorphisms directly associated with physiological traits and expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL) driving variation in six temperature specific physiological traits (standard metabolic rate, thermal tolerance, and four substrate specific cardiac metabolic rates). Not surprisingly, there were few, only five, SNPs directly associated with physiological traits. Yet, by focusing on a select set of mRNAs belonging to co-expression modules that explain up to 82% of temperature specific (12{degrees}C or 28{degrees}C) metabolism and thermal tolerance, we identified hundreds of significant eQTL for mRNA whose expression affects physiological traits. Surprisingly, most eQTL (97.4% for heart and 96.7% for brain) of eQTL were trans-acting. This could be due to higher effect size or greater importance of trans versus cis acting eQTLs for mRNAs that are central to co-expression modules. That is, we may have enhanced the identification of trans-acting factors by looking for SNPs associated with mRNAs in co-expression modules that are known to be correlated with the expression of 10s or 100s of other genes, and thus have identified eQTLs with widespread effects on broad gene expression patterns. Overall, these data indicate that the genomic mechanism driving physiological variation across environments is driven by trans-acting tissue specific mRNA expression.\n\nAO_SCPLOWUTHORC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWIn the salt marsh killifish Fundulus heteroclitus there is amazingly large variation in physiological traits assumed to be under stabilizing selection, which should reduce their variation. To discern the heritability of this physiological variation we took an innovative approach to define the DNA variation that drives mRNA expression linked to physiological variation. This indirect approach revealed many DNA sequence variants associated with physiological variation via their effect on mRNA expression. Surprisingly, these changes were not in the mRNAs themselves, but in unlinked distant genes which regulate mRNA expression. That is, the vast majority (>95%) were trans-acting. This is surprising because trans-acting effects are found less often than DNA variants within or close to mRNA expression genes. Our results are likely related to the select subset of mRNAs across environments that are linked to physiological variation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.15.524165"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.15.524160", "title": "Linear versus Nonlinear Muscle Networks: A Case Study to Decode Hidden Synergistic Patterns During Dynamic Lower-limb Tasks", "authors": "O'Keeffe, R.; Rathod, V.; Shirazi, S.

The results of study showed that the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the MM constant (KM) obtained from a robust nonlinear regression (RNR) using v values in the literature were respectively between 21 and 26-fold and 6.56 to 61.2-fold greater than values generated from other method such as double reciprocal plot (drp), reciprocal variant of direct linear plot (RVDLP), and new method (z-model) derived based on MM equation; the Vmax and KM values (for alpha-amylase) calculated based on the RVDLP using the uncorrected v values were respectively 1.26- and 1.264-fold greater than the values using corrected v values; based on the z method, the Vmax and KM values using the uncorrected v values were 179.8- and 9.35-fold greater than the values using their corrected counterparts.

To further understand SAMHD1 biology and to investigate the potential of targeting this enzyme as a neoadjuvant to existing chemotherapies we set out to discover selective small molecule-based inhibitors of SAMHD1. Here we report a discovery pipeline encompassing a biochemical screening campaign and a set of complementary biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based readouts for further characterisation of the screen output. The identified hit compound TH6342 and its analogues, accompanied by their inactive negative control analogue TH7126, demonstrated specific, low M potency in inhibiting the hydrolysis of both natural substrates and nucleotide analogue therapeutics, shown using complementary enzyme-coupled and direct enzymatic activity assays. Their mode of inhibition was subsequently detailed by coupling kinetic studies with thermal shift assays, where TH6342 and analogues were shown to engage with pre-tetrameric SAMHD1 and deter the oligomerisation and allosteric activation of SAMHD1 without occupying nucleotide binding pockets. We further outline the development and application of multiple cellular assays for assessing cellular target engagement and associated functional effects, including CETSA and an in-cell dNTP hydrolase activity assay, which highlighted future optimisation strategies of this chemotype.

It is also reported that under certain conditions they can react with the hydroxyl groups of serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y).

In this study, we applied a novel small molecule inhibitor of HuR to define the functional role of HuR in the acute response to I/R injury and gain a better understanding of the HuR-dependent mechanisms during post-ischemic myocardial remodeling. Our results show an early (two hours post-I/R) increase in HuR activity that is necessary for early inflammatory gene expression by cardiomyocytes in response to I/R. Surprisingly, despite the reductions in early inflammatory gene expression at two hours post-I/R, HuR inhibition has no effect on initial infarct size at 24-hours post-I/R. However, in agreement with previously published work, we do see a reduction in pathological remodeling and preserved cardiac function at two weeks post-I/R upon HuR inhibition. RNA-sequencing analysis of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) at two hours post-LPS treatment to model damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-mediated activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) demonstrates a broad HuR-dependent regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine gene expression in cardiomyocytes. We show that conditioned media from NRVMs pre-treated with HuR inhibitor loses the ability to induce inflammatory gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) compared to NRVMs treated with LPS alone. Functionally, HuR inhibition in NRVMs also reduces their ability to induce endocrine migration of peripheral blood monocytes in vitro and reduces post-ischemic macrophage infiltration to the heart in vivo.

Generating time-resolved data sets, we defined A{beta} aggregate-correlated and anticorrelated proteome changes, a fraction of which was conserved in postmortem AD patient brain tissue, suggesting that proteome changes in 5xFAD mice mimic disease relevant changes in human AD. We detected a positive correlation between A{beta}42 aggregate deposition in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and the abundance of the lysosome-associated small GTPase Arl8b, which accumulated together with axonal lysosomal membranes in close proximity of extracellular A{beta} plaques in 5xFAD brains. Abnormal aggregation of Arl8b was observed in AD brain tissue. Arl8b protein levels were significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, a clinically accessible body fluid.\n\nConclusionsWe report a comprehensive biochemical and proteomic investigation of hippocampal and cortical brain tissue derived from 5xFAD transgenic mice, providing a valuable resource to the neuroscientific community. We identified Arl8b, with significant abundance changes in 5xFAD and AD patient brains. Arl8b might enable the measurement of progressive lysosome accumulation in AD patients and have clinical utility as a candidate biomarker.\n\nData are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD030348.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/18/2023.01.16.523715"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.17.524439", "title": "Human-derived cortical neurospheroids coupled to passive, high-density and 3D MEAs: a valid platform for functional tests", "authors": "Muzzi, L.; Di Lisa, D.; Falappa, M.; Pepe, S.; Maccione, A.; Pastorino, L.; Martinoia, S.; Frega, M.", "author_corresponding": "Monica Frega", "author_corresponding_institution": "1-Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, University of Twente, 7522 NB Enschede, The Netherlands. 2-Department of Human Genetics, Radboudumc, Donders Institute", "date": "2023-01-18", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "With the advent of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiation protocols, different methods to create in-vitro human-derived neuronal networks have been proposed.

Quantum chemical modeling is theoretically robust but requires significant amounts of computational time to produce a spectrum for a given target. Among deep learning techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have performed better than previous work with fingerprint-based neural networks in mass spectral prediction.1 To explore this technique further, we investigate the effects of including quantum chemically derived features as edge features in the GNN to increase predictive accuracy. The models we investigated include categorical bond order, bond force constants derived from Extended Tight-Binding (xTB) quantum chemistry, and acyclic bond dissociation energies. We evaluated these models against a control GNN with no edge features in the input graphs.

Mathematical models of physiological responses of plant hormones, such as brassinolide, have been successfully established for certain root tissue types, by evaluating apoplastic pH via fluorescence imaging.

To train our segmentation prediction models, we created a publicly available dataset composed of confocal microscopy images of A. thaliana root tissue using the pH-sensitive fluorescence indicator, and manually annotated segmentation masks that identify relevant tissue zones.

These enhanced abilities to regenerate, retained in the adult, protect the MRL mouse from degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). Here, we hypothesized that MSC derived from the regenerative MRL mouse could be involved in their regenerative potential through the release of pro-regenerative mediators.\n\nMethodTo address this hypothesis, we compared the secretome of MRL and BL6 MSC and identified several candidate molecules produced at significantly higher levels by MRL MSC than by BL6 MSC. We selected one candidate and performed functional in vitro assays to evaluate its role on MRL MSC properties including metabolic profile, migration, and chondroprotective effects. Using an experimental model for osteoarthritis (OA) induced by collagenase (CiOA), we assessed its contribution to MRL MSC protection from OA.\n\nResultsAmong the candidate molecules highly expressed by MRL MSC, we focused our attention on procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2), coding for the lysyl hydrolase LH2 in charge of post-translational modifications of collagen for its stability and stiffness. PLOD2 is induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) involved in the regeneration process of adult MRL mice.

Here, we show for the first time that human natural killer (NK) cells specifically express TAZ but not YAP, and TAZ serves to limit NK cytotoxicity. The TLR3 agonist, hiltonol, was able to trigger cytoplasmic sequestration of TAZ, which increased NK cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, a low dose of hiltonol enhanced the intracellular contractility of NK cells accompanied by an increase in active RhoA and myosin light chain phosphorylation, conceivably through an increase in ERK1/2 activation-dependent ROS production. Importantly, we showed that the dissociation of LATS1 from actin upon activation of contractility, is required to sequester TAZ in the cytoplasm. Functionally, hiltonol also reduced the NK cell surface inhibitory receptors, KIR3DL1 through c-Myc inhibition and PD-1 through enhanced contractility.

In contrast, previous work demonstrated that one AMP, Metchikowin (Mtk), has a single residue that segregates as either proline (P) or arginine (R) in populations of four different Drosophila species, some of which diverged more than 10 million years ago. The recurrent finding of this polymorphism regardless of geography or host species, coupled with evidence of balancing selection in Drosophila AMPs, suggest there is a distinct functional importance to each allele. The most likely hypotheses involve alleles having specificity to different pathogens or the more potent allele conferring a cost on the host. To assess their functional differences, we created D. melanogaster lines with the P allele, R allele, or Mtk null mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Here, we report results from experiments assessing the two hypotheses using these lines. In males, testing of systemic immune responses to a repertoire of bacteria and fungi demonstrated that the R allele performs as well or better than the P and null alleles with most infections. With some pathogens, however, females show results in contrast with males where Mtk alleles either do not contribute to survival or where the P allele outperforms the R allele. In addition, measurements of life history traits demonstrate that the R allele is more costly in the absence of infection for both sexes. These results provide strong in vivo evidence that differential fitness with or without infection and sex-based functional differences in alleles may be adaptive mechanisms of maintaining immune gene polymorphisms in contrast with expectations of rapid evolution. Therefore, a complex interplay of forces including pathogen species and host sex may lead to balancing selection for immune genotypes.

Mutations in IFT140 can cause a vast spectrum of diseases belonging to the group of ciliopathies, reaching from isolated retinal dystrophy to severe skeletal abnormalities and multi-organ diseases such as Mainzer-Saldino and Jeune syndrome. We hypothesise that missense mutations in IFT140 are hypomorphic leading to quantitative effects on a subset of protein-protein interactions.

In this work we assessed how 24 missense mutations in IFT140 affect interactions with other IFT and effector proteins using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry. Our data reveals that several mutations in IFT140 are hypomorphic and disrupt the stability of the IFT-A complex to varying degrees in a quantitative way. Allelic combination and the degree of IFT-A complex disruption in analysed missense mutations correlates with the severity of the observed phenotype in a subset of patients.

Using standard tools from statistical physics, a formalism is presented that re-expresses the stochastic equations describing allelic evolution as a partition functional over all possible allelic trajectories ( paths) governed by selection, mutation, and drift. A perturbative field theory is developed for strong additive selection, relevant to disease variation, that facilitates the straightforward computation of closed-form approximations for time-dependent moments of the allele frequency distribution across a wide range of non-equilibrium scenarios; examples are presented for constant population size, exponential growth, bottlenecks, and oscillatory size, all of which align well to simulations and break down just above the drift barrier. Equilibration times are computed and, even for static population size, generically extend beyond the order 1/s timescale associated with exponential frequency decay. Though the mutation load is largely robust to variable population size, perturbative drift-based corrections to the deterministic trajectory are readily computed. Under strong selection, the variance of a new mutations frequency (related to homozygosity) is dominated by drift-driven dynamics and a transient increase in variance often occurs prior to equilibrating. The excess kurtosis over skew squared is roughly constant (i.e., independent of selection, provided 2Ns {gtrsim} 5) for static population size, and thus potentially sensitive to deviation from equilibrium.

However, genetic diversity is often threatened, in particular in domestic animal populations where artificial selection, genetic drift and inbreeding are strong. In this context, cryopreserved genetic resources appear as a promising option to reintroduce lost variants and to limit inbreeding. However, while more common in plant breeding, the use of cryopreserved resources is less documented in animals due to a longer generation interval making it difficult to fill the performance gap due to continuous selection. Thus, this study investigates one of the only concrete cases presenting the results of the use of cryopreserved semen of a bull born in 1977 and belonging to a disappeared lineage, into the breeding scheme of a French local dairy cattle breed, the Abondance breed, more than 20 years later.\n\nResultsWe found that this re-used bull was very original relative to the current population and thus allowed to restore genetic diversity lost over time. The expected negative gap in milk production due to continuous selection has been absorbed in a few years by preferential mating with elite cows. Moreover, the re-use of this old bull did not increase the level of inbreeding, it even tended to reduce it by avoiding mating with relatives. Finally, the reintroduction of an old bull in the breeding scheme allowed for increased performance for reproductive abilities, a trait that was less subject to selection in the past.\n\nConclusionsThe use of cryopreserved material was efficient to manage the genetic diversity of an animal population, by mitigating the effects of both inbreeding and strong selection. However, attention should be paid toward mating in order to limit the disadvantages associated with the provision of genetic originality, notably a discrepancy in the breeding values for selected traits or an increase in inbreeding. Therefore, a careful characterization of the genetic resources available in cryobanks could help to ensure the sustainable management of populations and of local or small ones in particular.

Multiple living systematic reviews have been developed to assist professionals with up-to-date and trustworthy health information, but it is increasingly challenging for systematic reviewers to keep up with the evidence in electronic databases. We aimed to investigate deep learning-based machine learning algorithms to classify COVID-19 related publications to help scale-up the epidemiological curation process.\n\nMethodsIn this retrospective study, five different pre-trained deep learning-based language models were fine-tuned on a dataset of 6,365 publications manually classified into two classes, three subclasses and 22 sub-subclasses relevant for epidemiological triage purposes. In a k-fold cross-validation setting, each standalone model was assessed on a classification task and compared against an ensemble, which takes the standalone model predictions as input and uses different strategies to infer the optimal article class. A ranking task was also considered, in which the model outputs a ranked list of sub-subclasses associated with the article.\n\nResultsThe ensemble model significantly outperformed the standalone classifiers, achieving a F1-score of 89.2 at the class level of the classification task. The difference between the standalone and ensemble models increases at the sub-subclass level, where the ensemble reaches a micro F1-score of 70% against 67% for the best performing standalone model. For the ranking task, the ensemble obtained the highest recall@3, with a performance of 89%. Using an unanimity voting rule, the ensemble can provide predictions with higher confidence on a subset of the data, achieving detection of original papers with a F1-score up to 97% on a subset of 80% of the collection instead of 93% on the whole dataset.\n\nConclusionThis study shows the potential of using deep learning language models to perform triage of COVID-19 references efficiently and support epidemiological curation and review. The ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms any standalone model. Fine-tuning the voting strategy thresholds is an interesting alternative to annotate a subset with higher predictive confidence.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/19/2023.01.18.524571"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.17.524374", "title": "Effect of oncolytic virotherapy on immune microenvironment in immune subtypes identified in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma", "authors": "Wang, Z.; Peng, S.; Chen, X.; Xie, Z.; Li, S.", "author_corresponding": "Shao Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "Tsinghua University", "date": "2023-01-19", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "Tumor occurrence and progression are significantly influenced by immunity, and the immune infiltration and immune-related gene expression in solid tumors are closely correlated to the response of patients to immunotherapy. In this study, the level of tumor infiltrating immune cells in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma samples from the TCGA database were assessed using ssGSEA, and the tumor samples were divided into two subtypes (Imm_H and Imm_L) with different immune cell infiltration level. The differences in immune cell percentage and immune checkpoint gene expression between the two subtypes indicated that the Imm_H group had higher levels of immune infiltration, but also more infiltrated immunosuppressive cells and higher mRNA levels of immune checkpoint genes. Then the immune subtype-specific gene network was built and the main modules representing the genes and functions that differ between the two immune subtypes were identified. To explore the effect of oncolytic virus on tumor immune microenvironment, we constructed the previously developed synthetic adenovirus containing the synthetic sensory switch gene circuit, assessed the antitumor effect in mouse models, and measured the proportion of different cell types by single-cell RNA sequencing. The results showed that synthetic oncolytic virus inhibited tumor development and altered the proportion of infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that synthetic oncolytic virus may have different mechanism on the two immune subtypes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524374v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dffa9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be8e2eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68acf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33862f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/19/2023.01.17.524374"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.18.524660", "title": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.5 may be a cautionary variant by in silico study", "authors": "Sugano, A.; Kataguchi, H.; Ohta, M.; Someya, Y.; Kimura, S.; Maniwa, Y.; Tabata, T.; Takaoka, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Yutaka Takaoka", "author_corresponding_institution": "Toyama University Hospital", "date": "2023-01-21", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "In this research, we aimed to predict the relative risk of the recent new variants of SARS-CoV-2 as based on our previous research.

Although protein structure prediction has made tremendous progress since CASP14, the modeling accuracy still cannot meet the requirements to a certain extent. Especially, accurate modeling of multi-domain and orphan proteins remains a challenge. Therefore, an accurate and efficient protein scoring model should be developed urgently to guide the protein structure folding or ranking through deep learning. In this work, we propose a protein structure global scoring model based on equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), named GraphGPSM, to guide protein structure modeling and ranking. We construct an EGNN architecture, and a message passing mechanism is designed to update and transmit information between nodes and edges of the graph. Finally, the global score of the protein model is output through a multilayer perceptron. Residue-level ultrafast shape recognition is used to describe the relationship between residues and the overall structure topology, and distance and direction encoded by Gaussian radial basis functions are designed to represent the overall topology of the protein backbone. These two features are combined with Rosetta energy terms, backbone dihedral angles, and inter-residue distance and orientations to represent the protein model and embedded into the nodes and edges of the graph neural network. The experimental results on the CASP13, CASP14, and CAMEO test sets show that the scores of our developed GraphGPSM have a strong correlation with the TM-score of the models, which are significantly better than those of the unified field score function REF2015 and the state-of-the-art local lDDT-based scoring models ModFOLD8, ProQ3D, and DeepAccNet etc. The modeling experimental results on 484 test proteins demonstrate that GraphGPSM can greatly improve the modeling accuracy. GraphGPSM is further used to model 35 orphan proteins and 57 multi-domain proteins. The results show that the average TM-score of the models predicted by GraphGPSM is 13.2% and 7.1% higher than that of the models predicted by AlphaFold2.

The BV-BRC genus-specific protein families were used to define orthologs across the set of genomes, and a single binary classifier was built for predicting the presence or absence of each family in each genome. Each model was built using the nucleotide k-mers from a set of 100 conserved genes as features. The resulting set of 3,259 XGBoost classifiers had a per-genome average macro F1 score of 0.944 [0.943-0.945, 95% CI].

Although the chromatin modifying functions of BRD4 in inducible gene expression have been extensively investigated, its roles in post-transcriptional regulation are not as well understood. Based on its interaction with the transcriptional elongation complex and spliceosome, we hypothesize that BRD4 is a functional regulator of mRNA processing. To address this question, we combine data-independent analysis - parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF) with RNA-sequencing to achieve deep and integrated coverage of the proteomic and transcriptomic landscapes of human small airway epithelial cells exposed to viral challenge and treated with BRD4i. The transcript-level data was further interrogated for alternative splicing analysis, and the resulting data sets were correlated to identify pathways subject to post-transcriptional regulation.

To address this, we developed a high-throughput, long-read sequencing assay called HIV-PULSE (HIV Proviral UMI-mediated Long-read Sequencing). This assay uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to tag individual HIV-1 genomes, allowing for the omission of the limiting dilution step and enabling long-range PCR amplification of many NFL genomes in a single PCR reaction, while simultaneously overcoming poor single-read accuracy. We optimized the assay using HIV-infected cell lines and then applied it to blood samples from 18 individuals living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy, yielding a total of 1,308 distinct HIV-1 genomes. Benchmarking against the widely applied Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing assay revealed similar sensitivity (11% vs 18%) and overall good concordance, though at a significantly higher throughput.

This property has been exploited for development of diagnostic nucleic acid detection tools. In eukaryotic cells, CRISPR-Cas13 initially seemed to exclusively cleave the target RNA and consequently, CRISPR-Cas13 has been adopted as a specific RNA knockdown tool. Recently, several groups have reported unexpected toxicity or collateral cleavage when using CRISPR-Cas13 in eukaryotic cells, which seems difficult to reconcile with the reported target specificity. To understand these seemingly contradicting findings, we explored the collateral cleavage activity of six Cas13 systems, and show that only the most active ortholog in vitro, LbuCas13a, exhibits strong collateral RNA cleavage activity in human cells. LbuCas13a displayed collateral cleavage in all tested cell lines, targeting both exogenous and endogenous transcripts and using different RNP delivery methods. Using Nanopore sequencing, we found that cytoplasmic RNAs are cleaved without bias by LbuCas13a. Furthermore, the cleavage sites are highly specific and often present in Uracil containing single stranded RNA loops of stem-loop structures. In response to collateral RNA cleavage, cells upregulate stress and innate immune response genes and depending on target transcript levels, RNA degradation resulted in apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate that LbuCas13a can serve as a cell selection tool, killing cells in a target RNA specific manner.

Although these genetic associations to PrCa have been widely reported, functional characterization of these risk loci remains challenging.\n\nMethodsTo screen for regulatory SNPs, we designed a library containing 9133 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target 2,166 candidate SNP sites implicated in PrCa. We performed negative screening in dCas9-KRAB stable prostate cell lines and applied the RIGOR program to identify the essential SNPs for cell proliferation. We further characterized the regulatory role of a selected single nucleotide polymorphim (SNP, rs60464856) using luciferase reporter assay, ChIP-qPCR, and xCas9 base editing in prostate cells. Finally, we investigated the biological impact of the SNP-regulated gene RUVBL1 on cell proliferation and tumor growth via gene knockdown using in vitro and in vivo assays.\n\nResultsFrom interference of 2,166 candidate SNPs via CRISPR interference screening, the RIGOR program identified 117 SNPs that could regulate genes to promote growth advantage in prostate cancer cell lines. Compared to unselected SNPs, the 117 candidates tended to reside near 5 kb flanking the transcription start sites (p = 0.01). To characterize the regulatory role of these SNPs, we selected one SNP (rs60464856) for detailed analysis. This SNP was covered by multiple gRNAs significantly depleted in the screening (FDR<0.05). Pooled SNP association analysis in the PRACTICAL cohort showed significantly higher PrCa risk for the G allele (pvalue=1.2E-16). eQTL analysis showed that the G allele is associated with an increased expression of RUVBL1 in multiple datasets. To further validate the CRISPR interference effect, we transfected a gRNA targeting the rs60464856 site in the dCas9 stable cell lines and observed significant inhibition of the RUVBL1 expression. We also applied the xCas9 adenine base editor to convert the rs60464856 A into G allele and observed an increased RUVBL1 expression in subclones carrying the rs60464856 G allele in prostate cell lines. To test if any protein showed allele-specific binding at rs60464856, we used SILAC-based DNA pull-down proteomics and observed that cohesin subunits (including SMC3) preferred the A allele. ChIP qPCR assays showed significant enrichment of CTCF and SMC3 signals at the rs60464856 site with preferential binding to the A allele. To evaluate the potential role of this locus in maintaining long-range chromatin structure, we analyzed a HiC dataset and found that the rs60464856 locus enriched consistent chromatin interactions in prostate cell lines. To determine the potential role of the rs60464856 target gene, we knocked down the RUVBL1 via shRNA and observed significant proliferation inhibition in prostate cell lines. We also tested PC3 cells with RUVBL1 knockdown in nude mice xenografts and observed reduced tumorigenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that RUVBL1 expression was associated with the enrichment of cell cycle related pathways in both cell line and TCGA prostate cancer cohorts. Lastly, we showed that an increased RUVBL1 expression and its relevant pathway activation were associated with poor survival.\n\nConclusionWe applied the CRISPR interference screening at selected prostate cancer risk loci and identified over a hundred regulatory SNPs essential for prostate cell proliferation.

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating S100A1 protein levels is limited. We used the bioinformatics tool GPS-SUMO2.0 to identify a putative SUMO interacting motif (SIM) on S100A1. Consistently, a S100A1:SUMO interaction assay showed a Ca2+-dependent interaction of S100A1 with SUMO proteins. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) and COS1 cells, S100A1 protein abundance increased in the presence of overexpressed SUMO1 without affecting the S100A1 mRNA transcript. We then generated S100A1 truncation mutants, where the SIM motif was removed by truncation or in which the core residues of the SIM motif (residues 77-79) were deleted or replaced by alanine. In COS1 cells and NRVM, overexpression of these S100A1 mutants led to elevated S100A1 mutant mRNA levels but failed to produce respective protein levels. Protein expression of these mutants could be rescued from degradation by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. By using an information-driven approach to dock the three-dimensional structures of S100A1 and SUMO, we predict a novel interaction mode between the SIM in S100A1 and SUMO.

To overcome the drawbacks of using FBS in cell culture, a defined serum substitute medium needs to be developed. The development of such a medium depends on the cell type, which makes it impossible to use one universal serum substitute medium for all cells. Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells originated from the hematopoietic stem cell lineage that play an important role in regulating bone mass and quality. To date, no defined serum substitute medium formulations have been reported for osteoclast differentiation of monocytes derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we have attempted to develop such a serum substitute medium for the osteoclastogenesis process in a stepwise approach. Essential components were added to the medium while monocytes were cultured in 96-well plates and in Osteo-Assay well plates to analyze the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expressing multinucleated osteoclasts with distinct actin ring and to analyze the resorption activity of mature osteoclasts for 21 days, respectively. The serum substitute medium was aimed at supporting monocyte and later osteoclast survival, differentiation of monocytes towards multinucleated osteoclasts, and the resorption of mineralized matrix as a measure of functionality. All points were achieved after 21 days of culture in the developed serum substitute medium. This serum substitute medium could potentially replace FBS in osteoclastogenesis studies eliminating its debated use.

Progression of CTL to exhausted T lymphocytes (ETL) that overexpress inhibitory receptors can substantially decrease effector cytokines production and diminish cytolytic activity in tumor microenvironment (TME). However, while the activity levels of CTL and ETL are considered important determinants of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) response, it has been repeatedly observed that their predictive power of the latter is quite limited. Studying this conundrum on a large scale across the TCGA cohort, we find that ETL and CTL activity (estimated based on conventional gene signatures in the bulk tumor expression) is strongly positively correlated in most cancer types. We hypothesized that the limited predictive power of CTL activity might result from the high concordance of CTL and ETL activities, which mutually cancels out their individual antagonistic effects on ICI response.\n\nMethods & ResultsConsequently, we have set out to identify a set of genes whose expression identifies a subset of patients where the CTL and ETL correlation is diminished, such that the association between these CD8+ T cell states and ICIs response is enhanced. Analyzing TCGA melanoma bulk gene expression, we identified a set of genes whose over-expression markedly diminishes the CTL and ETL correlation, termed a decoupling signature (DS). Indeed, we first find that the correlation between ETL and CTL activities is indeed markedly lower across high scoring DS patients than that observed across low scoring DS patients in numerous independent melanoma ICIs cohorts. Second, importantly, this successful decoupling increases the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in high DS scoring patients. We show that the resulting prediction accuracy is superior to other state-of-art ICI predictive transcriptomic signatures.\n\nSignificanceThe new decoupling score boosts the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in melanoma.

Yet no major heat shock response regulating transcription factor is encoded on chromosome 21, leaving it unclear why trisomy 21 itself would cause a heat shock response, or how it would impact the ability of blood cells to subsequently respond when faced with heat shock stress. To explore these issues in a context independent of any trisomy 21 associated co-morbidities or developmental differences, we characterized the response to heat shock of two Iymphoblastoid cell lines derived from brothers with and without trisomy 21. To carefully compare the chromatin state and the transcription status of these cell lines, we measured nascent transcription, chromatin accessibility, and single cell transcript levels in the Iymphoblastoid cell lines before and after acute heat shock treatment. The trisomy 21 cells displayed a more robust heat shock response after just one hour at 42{degrees}C than the matched disomic cells.

The perspective is a relation between tissue topology and function, which could be explored beyond the scope of this manuscript.\n\nO_LIExperimental investigation of morphological effect of change of osmotic conditions on long-term tissue morphology and topology\nC_LIO_LIEffect of osmotic changes on transient tissue growth behaviour\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of recovery process of tissues post-osmotic-shock\nC_LIO_LIToxicity limits of osmolytes in mid- to long-term tissue evolution\nC_LIO_LITissue adaptation to physiological changes in environment\nC_LIO_LILong-term tissue stabilisation under altered osmotic conditions.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524301v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7863aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5d4d3forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a9486org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@acf053_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/20/2023.01.18.524301"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.18.524542", "title": "A mathematical model for axonal transport of large cargo vesicles", "authors": "Rahman, N.; Oelz, D.

Here we take different tack, and propose a deep-learning approach that finds low-dimensional representations of gene expression in which the response to genetic perturbation is highly predictable. We demonstrate that the interactions between genes that are cooperative in these representations are highly consistent with known ground-truth in terms of causal ordering, functional relatedness, and synergistic impact on cell growth and death.

With recent advancements in technologies that manipulate and measure the activity of thousands of genes at once at the single-cell level, scientists are now afforded with the opportunity to interrogate such relationships at scale. However, extracting useful information from the vast readouts of these technologies is non-trivial, in part due to their many-dimensional and noisy nature. Here we develop a machine learning model that allows for the interpretation of complex genetic perturbations in terms of a simple set of causal relations. By analyzing cooperative groups of genes identified by our model, we demonstrate the model can group genes accurately based on their biological function, their relative ordering up- or downstream in the flow of causation, and how their activities combine to affect cell growth and death. Our approach complements existing machine learning methods in providing a simple way to interpret causal mechanism governing genetic interactions and functional states of cells.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/20/2023.01.18.524617"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.17.524488", "title": "Implantable flexible multielectrode arrays for multi-site sensing of serotonin tonic levels", "authors": "Castagnola, E.; Robbins, E.

Chronic sampling of 5-HT is critical in tracking disease development as well as the time course of pharmacological treatments. Despite their value, in vivo chronic multi-site measurements of 5-HT have not been reported.\n\nTo fill this technological gap, we batch fabricated implantable glassy carbon (GC) microelectrode arrays (MEAs) on a flexible SU-8 substrate to provide an electrochemically stable and biocompatible device/tissue interface. Then, to achieve multi-site detection of tonic 5-HT concentrations, we incorporated the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/functionalized carbon nanotube (PEDOT/CNT) coating on the GC microelectrodes in combination with a new square wave voltammetry (SWV) approach, optimized for selective 5-HT measurement. In vitro, the PEDOT/CNT coated GC microelectrodes achieved high sensitivity towards 5-HT, good fouling resistance in the presence of 5-HT, and excellent selectivity towards the most common neurochemical interferents. In vivo, our PEDOT/CNT-coated GC MEAs were able to successfully detect basal 5-HT concentrations at different locations of the CA2 hippocampal region of mice in both anesthetized and awake head-fixed conditions. Furthermore, the implanted PEDOT/CNT-coated MEA achieved stable detection of tonic 5-HT concentrations for one week. Finally, histology data in the hippocampus shows reduced tissue damage and inflammatory responses compared to stiff silicon probes. To the best of our knowledge, this PEDOT/CNT-coated GC MEA is the first implantable flexible multisite sensor capable of chronic in vivo multi-site sensing of tonic 5-HT.

Recent empirical data implicates the role of memory-driven decision-making in cellular systems navigating uncertain future nutrient environments based on prior experience, wherein a distinct growth phenotype emerges in fluctuating conditions. We develop a simple stochastic mathematical model to describe the cellular decision-making required for systems to optimally navigate such uncertainty. We demonstrate that adaptive populations capable of sensing their environment and estimating the nutrient landscape more efficiently traverse changing environments. We find during environmental transitions that larger memory capacities strike a trade-off between inertia of past environmental memory and higher resolution for estimating the optimal phenotype whenever the underlying landscape is close to a critical break-even point. Moreover, systems that tune their memory capacity avoid growth penalties resulting from maladaptive phenotypes following changes to the metabolic landscape. Our model predicts that the nutrient availability of adaptive cells is universally reduced in fluctuating nutritional environments relative to those in constant ones, which recapitulates empirical observations in bacterial systems. Our findings demonstrate that this deviation is a consequence of environmental mis-estimation together with bet-hedging in uncertain adaptive landscapes, and suggests that this deviation is fully determined by cellular memory capacity and the proximity of the environmental landscape to the systems critical break-even environment. We anticipate that our mathematical framework will be more broadly useful for studying memory-driven cellular decision-making in biological contexts where there is a trade-off for cells selecting from multiple phenotypic states.

However, the molecular mechanism by which these factors regulate the conformational changes that enable engagement of GP with the target membrane is unknown. Here, we apply fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to elucidate how the chemical environment of the late endosome promotes GP-membrane interaction, thereby facilitating virus entry. We first investigate the role of anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), which are found in the membrane of the late endosome. We find that these lipids enable robust binding of GP to membranes in a pH- and Ca2+-dependent manner. We then identify residues in GP that sense pH and trigger conformational changes that make the fusion loop available for insertion into the membrane. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest the structural basis for pH-trigger conformational changes. We similarly confirm residues in the fusion loop that mediate GPs interaction with Ca2+, which likely promotes local conformational changes in the fusion loop and mediates electrostatic interactions with the anionic phospholipids. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how the environment of the late endosome regulates the timing and efficiency of virus entry.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/20/2023.01.18.524651"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.19.524756", "title": "piRNA processing by a trimeric Schlafen-domain nuclease", "authors": "Podvalnaya, N.; Bronkhorst, A.

Although pituitary hormones are conserved mediators of life-history transitions, regulatory networks are less understood in fish. However, the relatively long life-cycles and germline-dependent maturation of classical fish models are less compatible with rapid exploration of adult physiology, particularly in females. Here, we describe a high-throughput platform that combines, for the first time, loss- and gain-of-function of peptide hormones in a naturally short-lived fish. As a proof-of-principle, we first manipulate growth by mutating growth hormone (gh1) in the turquoise killifish (N. furzeri). Next, to rescue growth defects, we designed a vector in which hormones are tagged by a self-cleavable fluorescent reporter, and are ectopically expressed using intramuscular electroporation. A single injection of a gh1-T2A-GFP plasmid was sufficient to produce a stable expression of tag-free hormone and rescue growth phenotypes. This, in contrast to current practice for which multiple injections of recombinant hormones are required. We demonstrate the versatility of our platform by rescuing female sterility, which is induced by manipulating the follicle stimulating hormone (fshb). As killifish maturation is germline-independent, both sexes can be explored in genetic models with germline defects. Finally, we describe a doxycycline-inducible system for tunable expression control.

Therefore, using a linear representative reference can cause a reference bias. Graph-based pangenome methods have been developed to tackle this problem. However, comparisons in DNA space is still challenging due to this high diversity. In contrast, amino acids have higher similarity due to evolutionary constraints, resulting in conserved amino acids that, however, may be encoded by several synonymous codons. Coding regions cover the majority of the genome in prokaryotes. Thus, building panproteomes leverages the high sequence similarity while not losing much of the genome in non-coding regions.\n\nResultsWe present PanPA, a method that takes a set of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins or protein clusters, indexes them, and builds a graph for each MSA. In the querying step, it can align DNA or amino acid sequences back to these graphs. We first showcase that PanPA generates correct alignments on a panproteome from 1,350 E. coli. To demonstrate that panproteomes allow longer phylogenetic distance comparison, we compare DNA and protein alignments from 1,073 S. enterica assemblies against E. coli reference genome, pangenome, and panproteome using BWA, GraphAligner, and PanPA respectively, where PanPA was able to produce around 22% more alignments.

We find that unwinding and decay of the miRNA star strand is weakly defective in the absence of slicing, with the largest effect observed in embryos. Argonaute-Like Gene 2 (ALG-2) is more dependent on slicing for unwinding than ALG-1. The miRNAs that displayed the greatest (albeit very minor) dependence on slicing for unwinding tend to form stable duplexes with their star strand, and in some cases, lowering duplex stability alleviates dependence on slicing. While a few miRNA guide strands are reduced in slicing mutants, the basis of this is unclear since changes were not dependent on EBAX-1, a factor in the Target-Directed miRNA Degradation (TDMD) pathway. Gene expression and gross phenotype were wild type in slicing mutants, indicating that 1) slicing is not required for target regulation and 2) the weak unwinding defect does not significantly reduce the pool of functional miRISC.

Therefore, the treatment of SCI, especially the suppression of secondary injuries, is a major focus of attention in the field of neuroscience. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that zinc therapy can exert neuroprotective effects in mice after acute SCI, including reducing the inflammatory response in the central nervous system, decreasing the neuronal apoptosis and downregulating oxidative stress at the region of injury. However, little is known about how zinc therapy systematically alleviates SCI.

Among the results, we found that zinc therapy-induced alterations in the IL-17 inflammatory pathway and produced immune heterogeneity in microglia which are the inherent immune cells in the central nervous system. By cell subpopulations clustering analysis, we defined seven microglia subpopulations in zinc-therapy spinal cord tissue and identified the presence of novel VEGFA+ microglia.

Previous proposed tests have primarily been focused on simulated data and have seen limited application to actual datasets.. The growing accessibility of systematic single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, often accompanied by bulk RNA sequencing from related or matched samples, makes it possible to benchmark the existing deconvolution methods more objectively. Here, we propose a comprehensive assessment of 29 available deconvolution methods, leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from different organs and tissues. We offer a new comprehensive framework to evaluate deconvolution across a wide range of scenarios and we provide guidelines on the preprocessing of input matrices. We then validate deconvolution results on a gold standard bulk Polymorphonuclear Peripheral/Blood Mononuclear cell (PMN/PBMC) dataset with well known cell-type proportions. We show that single-cell regression-based deconvolution methods perform well but their performance is highly dependent on the reference selection and the tissue type. Our study also explores the significant impact of various batch effects on deconvolution, including those associated with sample, study, and technology, which have been previously overlooked.

Multiple species of the fungi Ophiocordyceps infect ants, but in a species-specific manner; one fungal species co-evolved to successfully modify the behavior of one ant species. However, several characteristics of the behavioral modification seem to be similar across different Ophiocordyceps-ant systems, including a preference for the time of the day for manipulating host behavior. In this study, we explored the various mechanisms via which the circadian clock of Ophiocordyceps might be playing a role in modifying host behavior. We studied O. camponoti-floridani that modifies the behavior of its ant host Camponotus floridanus. To separate the role of the clock in behavior manipulation, from its role in growth and survival, we compared the daily gene expression profile of O. camponoti-floridani to a generalist, non-manipulating fungal parasite, Beauveria bassiana, which also successfully infects the same ant host.\n\nResultsMajority of the 24h rhythmic O. camponoti-floridani genes show peak expression before or at the transitions between light and dark. Rhythmic genes in O. camponoti-floridani, for which B. bassiana lacks an ortholog, were overrepresented for enterotoxin genes. Around half of all genes that show 24h rhythms in either O. camponoti-floridani or B. bassiana showed a consistent difference in their temporal pattern of daily expression. At the halfway mark in O. camponoti-floridani infections, when diseased ants show a loss of 24h rhythms in daily foraging, several fungal clock genes, including Frequency, showed differential expression. Network analyses revealed a single gene cluster, containing White Collar 1 and 2, that showed overrepresentation for genes oscillating every 24h in liquid culture as well as genes differentially expressed while growing inside the ant head.\n\nConclusionThis study identifies several sets of putatively clock-controlled genes and biological processes in O. camponoti-floridani that likely plays a role in modifying the behavior of its ant host. Differential expression of O. camponoti-floridani clock genes or 24h-rhythmic genes during infection is suggestive of either a loss of daily rhythm or a change in the amplitude of rhythmic gene expression. Both possibilities would suggest that a disease-associated change occurs to the functioning of the O. camponoti-floridani clock, and its output, while the fungi grows inside the ant head.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.20.524843"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.19.524781", "title": "Defining the contribution of microRNA-specific slicing Argonautes in animals", "authors": "Pal, A.; Vasudevan, V.; Houle, F.; Lantin, M.; Maniates, K.

This biting midge species is the primary vector of several viruses affecting both wildlife and livestock, thus a better understanding of the population dynamics of this species can help inform epidemiological studies. We found no significant genetic differentiation between months or years, and no correlation between adult populations and the inbreeding coefficient (FIS).

Interestingly, we also found a high number of private and rare alleles, which suggests both a large, stable population, as well as a constant influx of migrants from nearby populations. Overall, we showed that the high number of migrants maintains a high level of genetic diversity by introducing new alleles, while this increased diversity is counterbalanced by recurrent bottleneck events potentially purging unfit alleles each year.

Interestingly, codon optimality, previously postulated to dictate mRNA stability, only strongly affects decay of conserved and abundant transcripts, such as coding for ribosomal protein subunits.

One-third of the atmospheric anthropogenic CO2 emissions are dissolved in the oceans affecting the chemical equilibrium of seawater, which in turn leads to a decrease in pH and carbonate ion (CO32-) concentration, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification (OA). This chemical disequilibrium can be detrimental to marine organisms (e.g., mollusks) that fabricate mineralized structures based on calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Most studies on the effect of reduced pH in seawater have been conducted on the early developmental stages of shell-building invertebrates, neglecting how adult individuals face OA stress. Here, we evaluate histological, secretory, and transcriptional changes in the mantle of adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas) exposure to ambient (8.0 {+/-} 0.2) and reduced (7.6 {+/-} 0.2) pH during 20 days. Most histological observations did not show differences in terms of mantle cell morphology. However, Alcian Blue/PAS staining revealed significant differences in the number of Alcian Blue positive cells in the mantle edge, suggesting a decrease in the secretory activity in this morphogenetic zone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 172 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mantle tissues from adult oysters kept in normal and reduced pH conditions. Almost 18% of the DEGs encode secreted proteins that are likely to be contributing to shell fabrication and patterning. 17 of 31 DEGs encoding secreted proteins correspond to oyster-specific genes, highlighting the fact that molluscan shell formation is underpinned by a rapidly evolving secretome. The GO analysis of DEGs encoding secreted proteins showed that they are involved in the cellular response to stimulus, response to stress, protein binding, and ion binding, suggesting these biological processes and molecular functions are altered by OA.

The results show that using either the average or the root-mean-square of the bivariate source-to-source FC estimates consistently outperforms the use of a representative time series from each area.\n\nWe concluded that the reconstructed activity in each brain region is too complex to be reduced to a single representative time series and that full multivariate approaches must be used to describe between-area FC from electrophysiological recordings accurately. Moreover, the high correlation between the FC values estimated from EEG and MEG suggests that the results found in the high-sensitivity, low-noise MEG can be transferable to the more affordable EEG, at least when high-quality source reconstruction is used.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/20/2023.01.19.524740"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.19.524761", "title": "Metabolomic characterization of behaviorally manipulated ants with multiomic data integration", "authors": "Will, I.; Attardo, G.

However, an unresolved issue is whether gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the signature transcripts alone is sufficient for prediction and differentiation, or whether it is necessary to use the original statistical model created when the signature was derived. Intra-method comparison is complicated by the unavailability of original training data, missing details about the original trained model, and inadequate publicly-available software tools or source code implementing models. To facilitate these signatures replicability and appropriate utilization in TB research, comprehensive comparisons between gene set scoring methods with cross-data validation of original model implementations are needed.\n\nObjectivesWe compared the performance of 19 TB gene signatures across 24 transcriptomic datasets using both re-rebuilt original models and gene set scoring methods to evaluate whether gene set scoring is a reasonable proxy to the performance of the original trained model. We have provided an open-access software implementation of the original models for all 19 signatures for future use.\n\nMethodsWe considered existing gene set scoring and machine learning methods, including ssGSEA, GSVA, PLAGE, Singscore, and Zscore, as alternative approaches to profile gene signature performance. The sample-size-weighted mean area under the curve (AUC) value was computed to measure each signatures performance across datasets. Correlation analysis and Wilcoxon paired tests were used to analyze the performance of enrichment methods with the original models.\n\nMeasurement and Main ResultsFor many signatures, the predictions from gene set scoring methods were highly correlated and statistically equivalent to the results given by the original diagnostic models. PLAGE outperformed all other gene scoring methods. In some cases, PLAGE outperformed the original models when considering signatures weighted mean AUC values and the AUC results within individual studies.\n\nConclusionGene set enrichment scoring of existing blood-based biomarker gene sets can distinguish patients with active TB disease from latent TB infection and other clinical conditions with equivalent or improved accuracy compared to the original methods and models. These data justify using gene set scoring methods of published TB gene signatures for predicting TB risk and treatment outcomes, especially when original models are difficult to apply or implement.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/20/2023.01.19.520627"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.20.524904", "title": "Signaling in microbial communities with open boundaries", "authors": "Winkle, J.

We assessed ROH number and location in two populations of red deer (a focal and comparison) to investigate the effect of population history. We investigated the role of recombination using both a physical map and a genetic linkage map to search for ROH.

Finally, we ran forward genetic simulations with varying population histories, recombination rates and levels of selection, allowing us to further interpret our empirical data. These simulations showed that population history has a greater effect on ROH distribution than either recombination or selection. We further show that selection can cause genomic regions where ROH are common, so called ROH hotspots, only when the effective population size (Ne) is large or selection is particularly strong. In populations having undergone a population bottleneck, genetic drift can outweigh the effect of selection. We show that most ROH hotspots in the Rum population are in line with expectations from neutral simulations, however two ROH hotspots show possible signatures of selection.

In this research, we developed a novel bioinformatics platform, VAG (Visualizing read alignments in graph genomes), to overcome these challenges.

This tool can extract specific sequence regions from a graph pangenome and display read alignments on different paths of a graph pangenome. In addition, VAG provides population-level presence/absence variations frequency analysis and sequence path navigation to identify the population differentiation regions. To demonstrate the usage, we investigated genetic variations using a rice graph pangenome with population-level sequencing data to identify important genes and gene clusters underlying the indica-japonica differentiation with VAG. After investigating read alignments on the graph pangenome, we identified many false-positive alignments due to TE insertions. To reduce the impact of these misleading alignments, we developed a navigation module to determine and filter those false-positive alignments based on the pair-end alignment information. The utilization of mate-pair information in VAG provides a reliable reference for variation identification.

Advances in the MD field allow modeling proteins with high accuracy. However, modeling metal ions and their interactions with proteins is still challenging for MD simulations. Over one-third of known protein structures bind metal ions and have various cellular functions, such as structural stability, catalysis, and regulation. NPL4 is a zinc-binding protein and works as a cofactor for p97, and together they regulate protein homeostasis. NPL4 is also of biomedical importance and has been proposed as the target of Antabuse, a drug recently repurposed for drug cancer treatment. Recent experimental studies have proposed that the Antabuse metabolites, bis-(diethyldithiocarbamate)-copper (CuET) and cupric ions released from CuET, induce NPL4 misfolding and consequent aggregation. However, the molecular details of the mechanisms of interactions of Antabuse metabolites with NPL4 and the consequent structural effects are still elusive. In this context, biomolecular simulations can help to shed light on the related structural details. To apply MD simulations to NPL4 and its interaction with copper or Antabuse metabolites the first important step is identifying a suitable force field to describe the protein in its zinc-bound states. A challenge is that we cannot rely on bonded parameters that could help to stabilize the interaction between the protein and zinc, overcoming the limitations of non-bonded parameters. This is due to the fact that, if we want to study the misfolding mechanism, we cannot rule out that the zinc ion may detach from the protein structure during the process and copper replaces it in the metal binding site. In light of the above observations, we compared different MD force fields, including non-bonded zinc and copper parameters, on different protein constructs. At first, we investigated the force-field ability to model the coordination geometry of the metal ions.

When designing Pool-seq studies, researchers need to decide the pool size (number of individuals) and average depth of coverage (sequencing effort). An efficient sampling design should maximize the accuracy of allele frequency estimates while minimizing the sequencing effort. We introduce an R package, poolHelper, enabling users to simulate Pool-seq data under different combinations of average depth of coverage, pool sizes and number of pools, accounting for unequal individual contribution and sequencing errors, modelled by parameters that users can modify. poolHelper can be used to assess how different combinations of those parameters influence the error of sample allele frequencies and expected heterozygosity. The mean absolute error is computed by comparing the sample allele frequencies obtained based on individual genotypes with the frequency estimates obtained with Pool-seq. Using simulations under a single population model, we illustrate that increasing the depth of coverage does not necessarily lead to more accurate estimates, reinforcing that finding the best Pool-seq study design is not straightforward.

However, there is still room for improvement in pre-training models on antibody sequence. On the one hand, existing protein pre-training models mainly utilize pre-training language models without fully considering the differences between protein sequences and language sequences; on the other hand, in comparison with other proteins, antibodies possess their uniqueness, which should be incorporated using specifically designed training methods.

Recent studies have identified the individual cell shape changes that drive the initiation and progression phases of CFF; however, the underlying mechanics of these changes are not yet well understood. During the progression phase, the furrow deepens as columnar cells from both the anterior and posterior directions fold inwards rotating by 90{degrees}. To analyze the mechanics of this process, we have developed an advanced 2D vertex model, which introduces multi-node representation of cellular membranes and allows us to capture the membrane curvature associated with pressure variation. Our investigations reveal some key mechanical features of CFF. As cells begin to roll over the cephalic furrow cleft, they become wedge-shaped as their apical cortices and overlying membranes expand, lateral cortices and overlying membranes release tension, internal pressures drop, and basal cortices and membranes contract. Cells then reverse the process by shortening apical cortices and membranes, increasing lateral tension, and causing internal pressures to rise. Since the basal membranes expand, the cells recover a rotated columnar shape at the end of this process. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the basal membranes may be passively reactive throughout the progression phase. We also find that the smooth rolling of cells over the cephalic furrow cleft necessitates that internalized cells provide a solid base through high membrane tensions and internal pressure levels, which allows transmission of tensile force that pulls new cells into the furrow. These results lead us to suggest that CFF may help establish a baseline tension across the apical surface of the embryo that would facilitate cellular coordination of other morphogenetic movements via mechanical stress feedback mechanisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMechanical forces and stress feedback are essential for the development of morphology and structure in the embryo. Although great progress has been made in understanding the genetic control of patterning and cell fate, mechanical stress contributions are not as well understood. Mechanical analyses of the apical constrictions initiating ventral furrow formation and subsequent invagination dynamics in Drosophila have shed considerable light on these processes; however, ventral furrow formation is only one of many morphogenetic movements. Cephalic furrow formation occurs simultaneously with ventral furrow formation, but its cell shape changes and invagination dynamics are radically different. This study shows that mechanical forces and feedback operating in cephalic furrow formation also differ considerably from those in ventral furrow, demonstrating a potentially wide array of mechanical processes in morphogenesis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/21/2023.01.19.524786"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.20.524890", "title": "Malaria parasite proliferation implicates a resource-dependent counter mechanism", "authors": "Stuermer, V.

We investigated underlying regulatory principles by quantifying nuclear multiplication dynamics in Plasmodium falciparum and knowlesi using super-resolution time-lapse microscopy. This revealed that the number of daughter cells was statistically independent of the duration of the nuclear division phase, indicating that a counter mechanism, rather than a timer, regulates multiplication. P. falciparum cell volume at the start of nuclear division correlated with the final number of daughter cells. As schizogony progressed, the nucleocytoplasmic volume ratio, which has been found to be constant in all eukaryotes characterized so far, increased significantly, possibly to accommodate the exponentially multiplying nuclei. Depleting nutrients by dilution of culture medium caused parasites to produce less merozoites and reduced proliferation but did not affect cell volume or total nuclear volume at the end of schizogony.

Recent efforts have characterized the DNA damage response (DDR) following progressive telomere erosion in human pluripotent cells, yet the broader impact of telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs) in these cells is poorly characterized. Here, we report on DNA damage signaling, cell cycle, and transcriptome-level changes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in response to telomere-internal DSBs. We engineered a novel human iPSC line with a targeted doxycycline-inducible TRF1-FokI fusion protein to acutely induce DSBs at telomeres. Using this model, we demonstrate that TRF1-FokI DSBs activate an ATR-dependent DDR in iPSCs, in contrast to an established ATM-dependent response to telomeric FokI breaks in differentiated cells. ATR activation leads to a potent cell cycle arrest in G2, which we show is p53-independent and can be rescued by treatment with an ATR inhibitor. Telomere lengths are remarkably well-maintained in the face of persistent TRF1-FokI induction. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to cripple the catalytic domain of telomerase, we show that telomerase is largely dispensable for survival and telomere length maintenance following telomeric breaks, which instead appear to be repaired by a mechanism bearing hallmarks of lengthening mediated by homologous recombination, so-called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).

However, the lack of representative species and complete genomic data associated with them has hampered the investigation of their biology and evolution. Here, we isolated and described two new species of mantamonads, Mantamonas vickermani sp. nov. and Mantamonas sphyraenae sp. nov., for each of which we generated transcriptomic sequence data, as well as a high-quality genome for the latter. The estimated size of the M. sphyraenae genome is 25 Mb; our de novo assembly appears to be highly contiguous and complete with 9,416 predicted protein-coding genes.

The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes that early life conditions affect later-life health in a manner that is only partially modifiable by later-life experiences. Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the influence of early life conditions on later life health. Recent epigenetic studies of adult blood samples have identified DNA-methylation sites associated with higher BMI and worse health (epigenetic-BMI).\n\nHere, we used longitudinal and twin study designs to examine whether epigenetic predictors of BMI developed in adults are valid biomarkers of child BMI and are sensitive to early life social determinants of health. Salivary epigenetic-BMI was calculated from two samples: (1) N=1,183 8-to-19-year-olds (609 female, mean age=13.4) from the Texas Twin Project (TTP), and (2) N=2,020 children (1,011 female) measured at 9 and 15 years from the Future of Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS).\n\nWe found that salivary epigenetic-BMI is robustly associated with childrens BMI (r=0.36 to r=0.50). Longitudinal analysis suggested that epigenetic-BMI is highly stable across adolescence, but remains both a leading and lagging indicator of BMI change. Twin analyses showed that epigenetic-BMI captures differences in BMI between monozygotic twins. Moreover, children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) and marginalized race/ethnic groups had higher epigenetic-BMI, even when controlling for concurrent BMI, pubertal development, and tobacco exposure. SES at birth relative to concurrent SES best predicted epigenetic-BMI in childhood and adolescence.\n\nWe show for the first time that epigenetic predictors of BMI calculated from pediatric saliva samples are valid biomarkers of childhood BMI that are sensitive to social inequalities. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that early life conditions are especially important factors in epigenetic regulation of later life health.

However, due to the difficulty of identifying phages, plasmids, and microeukaryotes from microbial communities, our understanding of these minor classes lags behind that of bacteria and archaea. Recently, several classifiers have been developed to separate one or two minor classes from bacteria and archaea in metagenome assemblies, but none can classify all of the four classes simultaneously.

Peroxisome hitchhiking requires the protein PxdA, which is conserved within the fungal subphylum Pezizomycotina, but absent from other fungal clades. Woronin bodies are specialized peroxisomes that are also unique to the Pezizomycotina. In these fungi, multinucleate hyphal segments are separated by incomplete cell walls called septa that possess a central pore enabling cytoplasmic exchange. Upon damage to a hyphal segment, Woronin bodies plug septal pores to prevent wide-spread leakage. Here, we tested if peroxisome hitchhiking is important for Woronin body motility, distribution, and function in A. nidulans. We show that Woronin body proteins are present within all motile peroxisomes and hitchhike on PxdA-labeled early endosomes during bidirectional, long-distance movements.

Genome editing technologies targeted to the SMN2 exon 7 mutation could offer a therapeutic strategy to restore SMN protein expression to normal levels irrespective of the patient SMN1 mutation. Here, we optimized a base editing approach to precisely edit SMN2, reverting the exon 7 mutation via an A*T-to-G*C base edit. We tested a range of different adenosine base editors (ABEs) and Cas9 enzymes, resulting in up to 99% intended editing in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts with concomitant increases in SMN2 exon 7 transcript expression and SMN protein levels. We generated and characterized ABEs fused to high-fidelity Cas9 variants which reduced potential off-target editing. Delivery of these optimized ABEs via dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors resulted in precise SMN2 editing in vivo in an SMA mouse model.

However, the extremely low concentration of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) fragments among the total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) remains a formidable challenge to overcome and statistical models have yet to be improved enough to become of practical use. In this study, we set about appraising the predictive value of a variety of binary classification models based on cfDNA sequencing using fragmentation features extracted around transcription start sites (TSSs). We investigated (1) features summarising mapped fragment density around each TSS, (2) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes versus coding genes and (3) selection criteria to generate gene classes to be assigned by the model. Given that, in healthy samples, most of the cfDNA comes from lymphomyeloid lineages, we could identify the model parametrisation with the best accuracy in those lineages using publicly available datasets of healthy patients cfDNA. Our results show that (1) the way tissue-specific gene classes are defined matters more than what fragmentation features are included, and (2) in particular, lncRNAs are more tissue specific than coding genes and stand out in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our results.\n\nAuthor summaryDying cells, even in healthy individuals, release a fraction of the digested fragments of their genetic material into the bloodstream. Interestingly, these circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments bear the footprint left by nucleosomes ; the position of which depends on the transcriptional state specific to each tissue. This footprint, given away by the sizes and genomic positions of cfDNA fragments, can be revealed by deep sequencing and statistical models can be trained to recognise the tissue from where those fragments originate. This information, if made sensitive enough, could be a useful medical technique to carry out so-called \"liquid biopsies\", allowing clinicians to diagnose at an early stage or to precisely monitor a number of diseases, including cancer.\n\nIn this work, we comprehensively evaluated the features of circulating DNA fragments in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites to increase the ability of statistical models to recognise the tissue of origin of cfDNA of healthy individuals. Broadly speaking, nucleosome patterns allow a statistical model distinguish active versus inactive genes or tissue-specific versus housekeeping genes. The purpose of this study was to find the classes of genes with the strongest ability to recognise the true tissue of origin.

To overcome the difficulties of studying nucleosome formation in vivo, we developed a microscopy assay that enables direct observation of de novo centromeric nucleosome recruitment and maintenance at single molecule resolution. Using this assay, we discover that CENP-A can arrive at centromeres without its chaperone, but stable incorporation depends on HJURP and on DNA-binding proteins of the inner kinetochore.

This reduces the ensembles conformational entropy, generating an effective entropic force that pulls away from the point of tethering. Recent experimental work has shown that this entropic force causes measurable, physiologically relevant changes to protein function, but how the magnitude of this force depends on the IDR sequence remains unexplored. Here we use all-atom simulations to analyze how structural preferences encoded in dozens of IDR ensembles contribute to the entropic force they exert upon tethering. We show that sequence-encoded structural preferences play an important role in determining the magnitude of this force and that compact, spherical ensembles generate an entropic force that can be several times higher than more extended ensembles.

They use an alternating-access mechanism to couple these downhill and uphill transport effectively. However, despite years of investigation, some fundamental aspects of this process still need to be elucidated. Namely, it remains to be determined the structure and energetics of relevant intermediate protein conformations along the transport cycle and how substrate binding alters them to ensure selective and active transport.\n\nIn this work, we resolve these questions for a prokaryotic homolog of the well-known cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, using enhanced-sampling all-atom simulations and an original method to translate trajectory data into free-energy landscapes. We base these simulations on the available X-ray structure of the protein, which so far could be resolved only in the outward-facing state. After assessing the good convergence of the simulation data and their consistency with previous crystallographic data, we corroborate the results against available solvent-accessibility and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) measurements; the latter are examined also using a novel methodology.\n\nThe results reveal the structural features of the inward-facing conformation of the transporter and provide direct evidence for a new type of mechanism. During the alternating-access transition, ions remain bound in the center of the protein. At the same time, two pseudo-symmetric helices slide across the lipid bilayer, opening a pathway to the binding sites from one side of the membrane while occluding access from the other. Additional simulations demonstrate that the alternating access transition requires the binding of either three Na+ or one Ca+ ion, as only in these occupancy states the occluded intermediate conformations are energetically accessible. Overall, our results explain at the molecular level the emergence of selective and active transport in this class of transporters, in agreement with the well-established 3Na+:1Ca+ stoichiometry.\n\nSignificanceMembrane transporters regulate critical cellular processes, ranging from substrate recruitment into the cell to ions homeostasis and signaling. Therefore, besides the general interest in rationalizing the function of these proteins, understanding their molecular mechanisms in detail is essential to identify possible inhibitors or stimulators that can be used as therapeutic agents for pathophysiological conditions. Here we used quantitative molecular simulation methods to elucidate the molecular steps of the transport cycle of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). This protein pertains to a prominent family of membrane transporters involved in cardiac diseases. The simulation results, validated with previous biophysical and biochemical experiments, provide new fundamental insight into the transport process of the NCX family, explaining at the molecular level their known selectivity and exchange stoichiometry.

To date, implementing these FG design principles has been primarily performed by varying the ratio of the hard phase to that of the soft phase. Such design approaches, however, lead to inaccurate mechanical properties within the transition zone. That is due to the highly nonlinear relationship between the material distribution at the microscale and the macroscale mechanical properties. Here, we 3D print micro-bricks from either a soft or a hard phase and study the nonlinear relationship between their arrangements within the transition zone and the resulting macroscale properties. We carry out experiments at the micro- and macroscales as well as finite element simulations at both scales. Based on the obtained results, we develop a co-continuous power-law model relating the arrangement of the micro-bricks to the local mechanical properties of the micro-brick composites. We then use this model to rationally design FGs at the individual micro-brick level and create two types of biomimetic soft-hard constructs, including a specimen modeling bone-ligament junctions in the knee and another modeling the nucleus pulposus-annulus fibrosus interface in intervertebral discs. We show that the implemented FGs drastically enhance the stiffness, strength, and toughness of both types of specimens as compared to non-graded designs. Furthermore, we hypothesize that our soft-hard FGs regulate the behavior of murine preosteoblasts and primary human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCc). We culture those cells to confirm the effects of soft-hard interfaces on cell morphology as well as on regulating the expression of focal adhesion kinase, subcellular localization, and YAP nuclear translocation of hBMSCs. Taken together, our results pave the way for the rational design of soft-hard interfaces at the micro-brick level and (biomedical) applications of such designs.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/21/2023.01.21.525002"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.20.525000", "title": "Intergenerational scaling law determines the precision kinematics of stochastic individual-cell-size homeostasis", "authors": "Joshi, K.; Biswas, R.

Yet they maintain their characteristic sizes across generations within a tightly controlled range. What rules ensure intergenerational stochastic homeostasis of individual cell sizes? Valuable clues have emerged from high-precision longterm tracking of individual statistically-identical Caulobacter crescentus cells as reported in [1]: Intergenerational cell size homeostasis is an inherently stochastic phenomenon, follows Markovian or memory-free dynamics, and cells obey an intergenerational scaling law, which governs the stochastic map characterizing generational sequences of characteristic cell sizes. These observed emergent simplicities serve as essential building blocks of the first-principles-based theoretical framework we develop here. Our exact analytic fitting-parameter-free results for the predicted intergenerational stochastic map governing the precision kinematics of cell size homeostasis are remarkably well borne out by experimental data, including extant published data on other microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, our framework naturally yields the general exact and analytic condition, necessary and sufficient, which ensures that stochastic homeostasis can be achieved and maintained. Significantly, this condition is more stringent than the known heuristic result for the popular quasi-deterministic adder-sizer-timer frameworks. In turn the fully stochastic treatment we present here extends and updates extant frameworks, and challenges the notion that the mythical \"average cell\" can serve as a reasonable proxy for the inherently stochastic behaviors of actual individual cells.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.20.525000"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.20.524975", "title": "Texture-Based Image Analysis For the Assessment of Soybeans", "authors": "Lee, A.; Hoffseth, K.", "author_corresponding": "Alexander Lee", "author_corresponding_institution": "Louisiana State University", "date": "2023-01-21", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "At 4.44 billion bushels worth an estimated $57.7 billion dollars, soybeans are one of the most produced crops in the United States and are appraised using a standard grading system set by the USDA(NASS, 2022).

Although centrifugation is a routine procedure in most medical laboratories, the factors that affect the efficacy of the centrifugation process have never been studied analytically. In this paper, we examine the effect of the centrifugation time on the efficacy of the centrifugation process by studying the dynamics of the blood cells via the well-known Langevin equation or equivalently, by solving the Fokker-Plank equation. Our result depicts that the speed of the centrifuge is one of the determinant factors concerning the efficacy of the centrifugation process. As the angular speed increases, the centrifugal force steps up and as result, the particles are forced to separate from the plasma or serum. The room temperature also considerably affects the dynamics of analyse during centrifugation. Most importantly, the generation of heat during centrifugation steps up the temperature within a centrifuge and as a result, not only the stability of the sample but also mobility of analyse is affected. We show that as the centrifuge temperature steps up, the velocity of the cells as well as the displacement of the cell in the fluid decreases. We then study the dynamics of the whole blood during capillary action where in this case the blood flows upward in a narrow space without the assistance of external forces. Previous investigations show that the height that the fluid rises increases as the surface tension steps up. The viscosity of the fluid also affects the capillary action but to date, the dependence of the height on viscosity has never been explored due to the lack of a mathematical correlation between the viscosity of blood and surface tension [1]. In this work, we first examine the correlation between surface tension and viscous friction via data fitting. Our result exhibits that the viscosity of the blood increases linearly as the surface tension increases. The mathematical relation between the height and viscous friction is derived. It is shown that the height of the blood that rises in capillary increases as the viscous friction steps up. As the temperature of the room steps up, the height also decreases. The dependence of erythrocytes sedimentation rate on surface tension is also studied. The results obtained in this work show that the ESR increases as surface tension steps down\n\nPACS numbersValid PACS appear here", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/21/2023.01.21.525013"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.20.524994", "title": "Developing a robust technique for denoising and extracting speech and breath sounds in voice recordings from asthmatic patients", "authors": "Sayed, S.

Selected strains were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore technology to characterise the genetic context of carbapenem resistance genes.\n\nResultsThe 86 A. baumannii isolates were phylogenetically diverse and belonged to 35 distinct sequence types (STs), 16 of which were novel. Thirty-eight (44.2%) isolates belonged to none of the known international clones (ICs). Over 50% of the isolates were phenotypically resistant to 10 of 12 tested antimicrobials. Majority (n=54) of the isolates were carbapenem-resistant, particularly the IC7 (100%) and IC9 (>91.7%) strains. blaOXA-23 (34.9%) and blaNDM-1 (27.9%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes detected. All blaOXA-23 genes were carried on Tn2006 or Tn2006-like transposons. Our findings suggest that the mobilisation of a 10kb Tn125 composite transposon is the primary means of blaNDM-1 dissemination.\n\nConclusionOur findings highlight an increase in blaNDM-1 prevalence and the widespread transposon-facilitated dissemination of carbapenemase genes in diverse A. baumannii lineages in southwestern Nigeria. We make the case for improving surveillance of these pathogens in Nigeria and other understudied settings.\n\nImportanceAcinetobacter baumannii are increasingly clinically relevant due to their propensity to harbour genes conferring resistance to multiple antimicrobials, as well as their ability to persist and disseminate in hospital environments and cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. Little is known about the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of these organisms in Nigeria, largely due to limited capacity for their isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our study characterised the diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clinical A. baumannii in southwestern Nigeria using whole-genome sequencing. We also identified the key genetic elements facilitating the dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes within this species.

DUXA lacks transcriptional activity but has DNA-binding and chromatin accessibility overlap with DUX4 and sDUX, including on ZGA genes and LTR elements, and can actually be converted into a DUX4-like cytotoxic factor by fusion to a synthetic transactivation domain.

Hydrazine is a biologically unique free intermediate in this metabolism, and is produced by the enzyme hydrazine synthase. Crystallization of  Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis hydrazine synthase allowed for an initial hypothesis of its reaction mechanism. In this hypothesis, nitric oxide is first reduced to hydroxylamine after which hydroxylamine is condensed with ammonium to form hydrazine. Hydrazine synthase is a tetraheme cytochrome c, containing two proposed active site hemes ({gamma}I & I) in the {gamma}- and -subunit, respectively, connected by an intra-enzymatic tunnel. Here we combined the data from electrochemistry-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, EPR and optical spectroscopy to shed light on the redox properties and protein dynamics of hydrazine synthase in the context of its reaction mechanism. Redox titrations revealed two low potential low spin hemes with midpoint potentials of [~]-360 mV and [~]-310 mV for heme II and {gamma}II, respectively. Heme {gamma}I showed redox transitions in the range of 0 mV, consisting of both low spin and high spin characteristics in optical and EPR spectroscopy. Electrochemistry-induced FTIR spectroscopy indicated an aspartic acid ligating a OH-/H2O at the heme {gamma}I axial site as a possible candidate for involvement in this mixed spin characteristic. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy confirmed the ability of heme {gamma}I to bind NO in the reduced state. Heme I exhibited a rhombic high spin signal, in line with its ligation by a proximal tyrosine observed in the crystal structure. Redox titrations down to -610 mV nor addition of dithionite resulted in the reduction of heme I, indicating a very low midpoint potential for this heme. In vivo chemistry at this heme I, the candidate for the comproportionation of hydroxylamine and ammonium, is thus likely to be initiated solely on the oxidized heme, in contrast to previously reported DFT calculations.

Since protein structure is more conserved than protein sequence, it seems natural to use structure alignments for distant homologs. However, structure alignments may not be suitable for inferring evolutionary relationships at the sequence level.\n\nResultsHere we investigate the mutual relationships between four protein similarity measures that depend on sequence and structure (fraction of aligned residues, sequence similarity, fraction of superimposed backbones and contact overlap) and the corresponding alignments. Changes in protein sequences and structures are intimately correlated, but our results suggest that no individual measure can provide a complete and unbiased picture of changes in protein sequences and structure. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid measure of protein sequence and structure similarity based on Principal Components (PC_sim). Starting from an MSA, we obtain modified pairwise alignments (PA) based on PC_sim, and from them we construct a new MSA based on the maximal cliques of the PA graph. These alignments yield larger protein similarities and agree better with the Balibase \"reference\" MSA and with consensus MSA than alignments that target individual similarity measures. Moreover, PC_sim is associated with a divergence measure that correlates strongest with divergences obtained from individual similarities, which suggests that it can infer more accurate evolutionary divergences for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees with distance methods.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ugobas/Evol_div\n\nContactubastolla@cbm.csic.es", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/22/2023.01.22.525078"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.22.525096", "title": "Blind Assessment of Monomeric AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Models with Experimental NMR Data", "authors": "Li, E.; Spaman, L.; Tejero, R.; Huang, Y.

A multimodal mass-connectivity distribution indicates that the translation and metabolism networks are each distinct, adaptive biochemical modules, and that the gaps between the modes reflect evolved responses to the functional use of metabolite, polypeptide and polynucleotide compounds. The chemical reaction network of cellular translation opens new avenues for exploring complex adaptive phenomena such as percolation and phase changes in biochemical contexts.\n\nSignificance StatementOne challenge in tracing the origin of life is understanding the emergence and coupling of information processing and metabolism, which often involves debating which function preceded the other. These functions can be articulated as a unified network of interacting objects that include RNAs, proteins and metabolites. We mapped all translation factors, their interactions and substrates as biochemical reactions and connected them to their corresponding metabolic pathways. The resulting network exhibits a multimodal mass distribution, and the metabolic and translation layers each likely have a heavy-tailed connectivity distribution, indicating modular coupling between the two. At the ecological level, this combination of traits is associated with both stability and adaptability. This work establishes a basis for exploring properties observed throughout biological organization that may be requisite features of prebiotic chemical networks.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/22/2023.01.21.524914"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.21.525037", "title": "Hep3D: A 3D single-cell digital atlas of the liver to study spatio-temporal tissue architecture", "authors": "Martinez, D.; Maldonado, V.; Perez, C.; Yanez, R.; Candia, V.; Kalaidzidis, Y.; Zerial, M.; Morales-Navarrete, H.; Segovia-Miranda, F.", "author_corresponding": "Fabian Segovia-Miranda", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.", "date": "2023-01-22", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) geometrical models are not only a powerful tool for quantitatively characterizing complex tissues but also useful for probing structure-function relationships in a tissue.

Here, we performed deep-tissue immunostaining, multiphoton microscopy, deeplearning techniques, and 3D image processing to computationally expand the number of simultaneously reconstructed tissue structures.

In addition to a complete description of bile canaliculi and sinusoidal network remodeling, our analysis uncovered unexpected spatiotemporal patterns of non-parenchymal cells and hepatocytes differing in size, number of nuclei, and DNA content. Surprisingly, we found that the specific depletion of KCs alters the number and morphology of the HSCs.

Rich data now comprehensively profile both the biological processes impacted by common drugs, and the human phenotypes known to be affected by these drugs.

They rely on a network of accessory proteins in vivo for correct formation and transport to the cell surface. RIC-3 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that physically interacts with nascent pLGIC subunits and promotes their oligomerization. It is not known why some N-AChRs require RIC-3 in heterologous expression systems, while others do not. Previously we reported that the ACR-16 N-AChR from the parasitic nematode Dracunculus medinensis does not require RIC-3 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is unusual because all other nematode ACR-16, like the closely related Ascaris suum ACR-16, require RIC-3. Their high sequence similarity limits the number of amino acids that may be responsible, and the goal of this study was to identify them. A series of chimeras and point mutations between A. suum and D. medinensis ACR-16, followed by functional characterization with electrophysiology, identified two residues that account for a majority of the receptor requirement for RIC-3. ACR-16 with R/K159 in the cys-loop and I504 in the C-terminal tail did not require RIC-3 for functional expression. Mutating either of these to R/K159E or I504T, residues found in other nematode ACR-16, conferred a RIC-3 requirement.

Thus, when DNA gets damaged, is essential to repair it in the most accurate fashion. Among different DNA lesions, DNA double strand breaks are specially challenging. An exquisite regulatory network reacts to local and global cues to control the choice between different DNA double strand break repair mechanisms to maximize genomic integrity. Such regulation relies mostly at the level of DNA end resection, the initial steps of the homologous recombination repair pathway. On the other hand, most cellular and organismal activities follow a 24 h oscillation known as the circadian cycle. Such repetitive changes are controlled by an intrinsic, molecular clock built-in at the cellular level which core components are the heterodimers BMAL1-CLOCK and CRY-PER. These inherent rhythms control many different aspects of the cellular metabolism, including the fate of many different DNA transactions. Here we have explored the regulation of the choice between different DNA double strand break repair pathways along the circadian cycle. We observed that DNA end resection shows a circadian oscillation, with a peak at dawn followed by a progressive reduction until dusk. Such regulations depend on the cellular levels of the circadian clock core component CRY1. Consequently, repair by homologous recombination mirrors CRY1 expression levels. Such modulation is controlled through the circadian regulation of the anti-resection activity, but not the protein levels, of CCAR2, that limits CtIP-mediated resection preferentially at nightfall. Additionally, such regulation requires a crosstalk between the DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of CRY1 by the kinase DNA-PK.

These statistics can provide strong evidence for either admixture or cladality, which can be robust to substantial rates of errors or missing data. f-statistics are guaranteed to be unbiased under \"SNP ascertainment\" (analyzing non-randomly chosen subsets of single nucleotide polymorphisms) only if it relies on a population that is an outgroup for all groups analyzed. However, ascertainment on a true outgroup that is not co-analyzed with other populations is often impractical and uncommon in the literature. In this study focused on practical rather than theoretical aspects of SNP ascertainment, we show that many non-outgroup ascertainment schemes lead to false rejection of true demographic histories, as well as to failure to reject incorrect models. But the bias introduced by common ascertainments such as the 1240K panel is mostly limited to situations when more than one sub-Saharan African and/or archaic human groups (Neanderthals and Denisovans) or non-human outgroups are co-modelled, for example, f4-statistics involving one non-African group, two African groups, and one archaic group. Analyzing panels of SNPs polymorphic in archaic humans, which has been suggested as a solution for the ascertainment problem, cannot fix all these problems since for some classes of f-statistics it is not a clean outgroup ascertainment, and in other cases it demonstrates relatively low power to reject incorrect demographic models since it provides a relatively small number of variants common in anatomically modern humans. And due to the paucity of high-coverage archaic genomes, archaic individuals used for ascertainment often act as sole representatives of the respective groups in an analysis, and we show that this approach is highly problematic. By carrying out large numbers of simulations of diverse demographic histories, we find that bias in inferences based on f-statistics introduced by non-outgroup ascertainment can be minimized if the derived allele frequency spectrum in the population used for ascertainment approaches the spectrum that existed at the root of all groups being co-analyzed. Ascertaining on sites with variants common in a diverse group of African individuals provides a good approximation to such a set of SNPs, addressing the great majority of biases and also retaining high statistical power for studying population history.

OA is one of the most common comorbidities of obesity, and obesity-related OA (ObOA) is a serious health concern because it shows heightened severity of tissue damage and also predominantly affects the working population. Unresolved inflammation is a major driver of ObOA, thus, resolving disease-associated inflammation is a viable strategy to treat ObOA. Resolvins are highly potent molecules that play a role in the resolution of inflammation and promote tissue healing. However, small molecules (like Resolvin D1; RvD1) have to be administered frequently or prior to injury because they lose their in vivo activity rapidly either by lymphatic clearance, or oxidation-mediated deactivation. In this study, we have encapsulated RvD1 in liposomes and established its efficacy in the mouse model of ObOA at much lower dosages than freely administered RvD1. Liposomal RvD1 (lipo-RvD1) acted as a source of the RvD1 molecules for ~11 days in vitro in synovial fluid derived from patients.

AKI is characterized by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. Associated Symptoms include feeling sick or being sick, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased urine output-although occasionally urine output remains normal, fluid retention-causing swelling in the legs or ankles, shortness of breath, fatigue and nausea. However, sometimes acute kidney injury causes no signs or symptoms and is detected by lab tests. Therefore, an urgent demand for non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AKI are highly desirable. This might enable the prevention of the progression from AKI to CKD.\n\nIn this study, we analysed the secretome of urine of an AKI patient cohort employing a kidney-biomarker cytokine assay. Based on these results we suggest, ADIPOQ, EGF and SERPIN3A as potential biomarkers, which might be able to detect AKI as soon as 24 h post-surgery. For the later stages, common biomarkers for the detection of AKI in both male and female patients we suggest, VEGF, SERPIN3A, TNFSF12, ANPEP, CXCL1, REN, CLU and PLAU. These markers in combination might present a robust strategy to identify the development of AKI as early as 24h or 72h post-surgery.

Progress in this direction can help boost related fields such as protein engineering, drug design, or genetic interpretation, but the task seems not to have been addressed by the scientific community. Following an initial explorative study, we extend here the application of a Molecular Dynamics-based approach -with the most accurate force field/water model combination previously found (Charmm22-CMAP/Tip3p)- to computing the folding energetics of a set of two-state and three-state proteins that do or do not carry a bound cofactor. The proteins successfully computed are representative of the main protein structural classes, their sequences range from 84 to 169 residues, and their isoelectric points from 4.0 to 8.9. The devised approach enables accurate calculation of two essential magnitudes governing the stability of proteins -the changes in enthalpy and in heat capacity associated to protein unfolding-, which are used to obtain accurate values of the change in Gibbs free-energy, also known as the protein conformational stability. The method proves to be also suitable to obtain changes in stability due to changes in solution pH, or stability differences between a wild-type protein and a variant. The approach addresses the calculation by difference, a shortcut that avoids having to simulate the protein folding time, which is very often unfeasible computationally.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.21.525008"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.22.525087", "title": "Serum albumin maintains Wnt water-solubility and activity", "authors": "Yeo, J.

HLA is a highly polymorphic region and thus difficult to impute. We therefore sought to evaluate HLA imputation accuracy, specifically in a West African population, since they are understudied and are known to harbor high genetic diversity. The study sets were selected from Gambian individuals within the Gambian Genome Variation Project (GGVP) Whole Genome Sequence datasets. Two different arrays, Illumina Omni 2.5 and Human Hereditary and Health in Africa (H3Africa), were assessed for the appropriateness of their markers, and these were used to test several imputation panels and tools. The reference panels were chosen from the 1000 Genomes dataset (1kg-All), 1000 Genomes African dataset (1kg-Afr), 1000 Genomes Gambian dataset (1kg-Gwd), H3Africa dataset and the HLA Multi-ethnic dataset. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles were imputed using HIBAG, SNP2HLA, CookHLA and Minimac4, and concordance rate was used as an assessment metric. Overall, the best performing tool was found to be HIBAG, with a concordance rate of 0.84, while the best performing reference panel was the H3Africa panel with a concordance rate of 0.62. Minimac4 (0.75) was shown to increase HLA-B allele imputation accuracy compared to HIBAG (0.71), SNP2HLA (0.51) and CookHLA (0.17). The H3Africa and Illumina Omni 2.5 array performances were comparable, showing that genotyping arrays have less influence on HLA imputation in West African populations. The findings show that using a larger population-specific reference panel and the HIBAG tool improves the accuracy of HLA imputation in West African populations.\n\nAuthor SummaryFor studies that associate a particular HLA type to a phenotypic trait for instance HIV susceptibility or control, genotype imputation remains the main method for acquiring a larger sample size. Genotype imputation, process of inferring unobserved genotypes, is a statistical technique and thus deals with probabilities. Also, the HLA region is highly variable and therefore difficult to impute. In view of this, it is important to assess HLA imputation accuracy especially in African populations. This is because the African genome has high diversity, and such studies have hardly been conducted in African populations. This work highlights that using HIBAG imputation tool and a larger population-specific reference panel increases HLA imputation accuracy in an African population.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.23.525129"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.22.525022", "title": "Genomic and Proteomic Analysis of Patients with Reoccurring Discrete Subaortic Stenosis", "authors": "Birla, R.; Singampalli, K.

Since R. euintracellularis has evaded isolation, heterologous expression of genes in model laboratory organisms was performed to identify the function of proteins from the endosymbiont. Gene complementation of a cyanobacterial invertase mutant and expression of the protein in Escherichia coli showed that R. euintracellularis HH01 possesses a neutral invertase that splits sucrose producing glucose and fructose. Several solute binding proteins (SBPs) of ABC transporters encoded in the genome of R. euintracellularis HH01 were expressed in E. coli and their substrates were characterized. The selected SBPs directly linked the host as the source of several substrates, e.g., sugars (sucrose, galactose), amino acids (glutamate, phenylalanine) and a polyamine (spermidine), to support the cyanobacterial symbiont. Finally, transcripts of genes encoding the invertase and SBPs were consistently detected in wild populations of H. hauckii collected from multiple stations and depths in the western tropical North Atlantic. Our results support the idea that the diatom host provides the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium with organic carbon to fuel N2 fixation. This knowledge is key to understand the physiology of the globally significant H. hauckii-R. euintracellularis symbiosis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDiatom diazotroph associations (DDAs) between diatoms and N2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) have a relevant impact on N2 fixation-based production, but the mechanisms underlying their integrated N2 and CO2 fixation remain unstudied. In the association between the diatom Hemiaulus hauckii (host) and the N2-fixing, heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Richelia euintracellularis (endosymbiont), the cyanobacterium is uncultivable. Here we used heterologous expression of genes from the endosymbiont to identify the function of proteins involved in the utilization of organic carbon from the host. The importance of these proteins was also confirmed by estimating gene expression in environmental samples. Our results show that the metabolisms of the symbiotic partners are integrated allowing the host to sustain the physiology of the endosymbiont for an important ecological role.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.23.525141"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.23.525163", "title": "Caltubin regulates microtubule stability via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms favouring neurite regrowth", "authors": "Barszczyk, A.; Bandura, J.; Zhang, Q.; Wang, H.; Deurloo, M.; Ahmed, Y.; Dong, A.; Meister, P.; Lee, J.; Sun, H.-S.; Tong, Y.; Feng, Z.-P.", "author_corresponding": "Zhong-Ping Feng", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Toronto", "date": "2023-01-23", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Microtubule regulation is highly controlled in nerve regeneration.

They have the potential to replace or complement the current PCR-based methods thanks to their improved inclusivity and analytical sensitivity, as well as their overall good repeatability and reproducibility. Cross-contamination is a well-known phenomenon in molecular diagnostics and corresponds to the exchange of genetic material between samples. Cross-contamination management was a key drawback during the development of PCR-based detection and is now adequately monitored in routine diagnostics. HTS technologies are facing similar difficulties due to their very high analytical sensitivity. As a single viral read could be detected in millions of sequencing reads, it is mandatory to fix a detection threshold that will be influenced by cross-contamination. Cross-contamination monitoring should therefore be a priority when detecting viruses by HTS technologies.\n\nResultsWe present Cont-ID, a bioinformatic tool designed to check for cross-contamination by analysing the relative abundance of virus sequencing reads identified in sequence metagenomic datasets and their duplication between samples. It can be applied when the samples in a sequencing batch have been processed in parallel in the laboratory and with at least one external alien control. Using 273 real datasets, including 68 virus species from different hosts (fruit tree, plant, human) and several library preparation protocols (Ribodepleted total RNA, small RNA and double stranded RNA), we demonstrated that Cont-ID classifies with high accuracy (91%) viral species detection into (true) infection or (cross) contamination. This classification raises confidence in the detection and facilitates the downstream interpretation and confirmation of the results by prioritising the virus detections that should be confirmed.\n\nConclusionsCross-contamination between samples when detecting viruses using HTS can be monitored and highlighted by Cont-ID (provided an alien control is present).

Cortical actin (CA), the subset of the actin cytoskeleton subjacent to the plasma membrane (PM), plays a large role in cell surface receptor organization. This was however shown largely through actin perturbation experiments, which raise concerns of nonspecific effects and preclude quantification of actin architecture and dynamics under unperturbed conditions. These limitations make it challenging to predict how changes in CA properties can affect receptor organization. To derive direct relationships between the architecture and dynamics of CA and the spatiotemporal organization of PM proteins, including cell surface receptors, we developed a multiscale imaging and computational analysis framework based on the integration of single-molecule imaging (SMI) of PM proteins and fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) of CA (combined: SMI-FSM) in the same live cell. SMI-FSM revealed differential relationships between PM proteins and CA based on the PM proteins actin binding ability, diffusion type and local CA density. It also highlighted the complexity of cell wide actin perturbation, where we found that global changes in actin properties caused by perturbation were not necessarily reflected in the CA properties near PM proteins, and the changes in PM protein properties upon perturbation varied based on the local CA environment. Given the widespread use of SMI as a method to study the spatiotemporal organization of PM proteins and the versatility of SMI-FSM, we expect it to be widely applicable to enable future investigation of the influence of CA architecture and dynamics on different PM proteins, especially in the context of actin-dependent cellular processes, such as cell migration.\n\nSignificancePlasma membrane protein organization, an important factor for shaping cellular behaviors, is influenced by cortical actin, the subset of the actin cytoskeleton near the plasma membrane. Yet it is challenging to directly and quantitatively probe this influence. Here, we developed an imaging and analysis approach that combines single-molecule imaging, fluorescent speckle microscopy and computational statistical analysis to characterize and correlate the spatiotemporal organization of plasma membrane proteins and cortical actin.

However, the molecular mechanism of how the quality of the liquid droplets formed by NPM1 is regulated is currently not well understood. In this manuscript, we revealed the regulatory mechanism of NPM1 oligomer formation and its relationship with the ability to form liquid droplets. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutant protein analyses suggest that the acidic amino acids in the N-terminal and central disordered regions of NPM1 disturb the key interactions between monomers. We also demonstrate that mutants with attenuated oligomer stability form liquid droplets as do the wild-type; the fluidity of the formed liquid droplets was greater than that of the wild-type. These results suggest that the stability of NPM1 oligomers is a critical determinant of liquid droplet quality. Furthermore, we observed that when the net negative charges in the acidic disordered regions were increased by phosphomimetic mutations at Ser125, the NPM1 oligomer stability decreased, which increased the fluidity of the liquid droplets.

Given that failure to reverse fibrosis is a major limitation of both standard of care and first in class precision therapeutics for DCM, this study examined whether cardiac fibroblast-mediated regulation of the hearts material properties is essential for the DCM phenotype. Here we report in a mouse model of inherited DCM that prior to the onset of fibrosis and dilated myocardial remodeling both the myocardium and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffen from switches in titin isoform expression, enhanced collagen fiber alignment, and expansion of the cardiac fibroblast population, which we blocked by genetically suppressing p38 in cardiac fibroblasts. This fibroblast-targeted intervention unexpectedly improved the primary cardiomyocyte defect in contractile function and reversed ECM and dilated myocardial remodeling. Together these findings challenge the long-standing paradigm that ECM remodeling is a secondary complication to inherited defects in cardiomyocyte contractile function and instead demonstrate cardiac fibroblasts are essential contributors to the DCM phenotype, thus suggesting DCM-specific therapeutics will require fibroblast-specific strategies.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.23.523684"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.23.525200", "title": "Compressed Perturb-seq: highly efficient screens for regulatory circuits using random composite perturbations", "authors": "Yao, D.; Binan, L.; Bezney, J.; Simonton, B.; Freedman, J.; Frangieh, C.

The COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected every part of the world, and the situation in the world is getting worse with the emergence of novel variants. Our study aims to explore the genome of SARS-,CoV2 followed by in silico analysis of its proteins.\n\nMethodsDifferent nucleotide and protein variants of SARS-Cov2 were retrieved from NCBI. Contigs & consensus sequences were developed to identify variations in these variants by using SnapGene. Data of variants that significantly differ from each other was run through Predict Protein software to understand changes produced in protein structure The SOPMA web server was used to predict the secondary structure of proteins. Tertiary structure details of selected proteins were analyzed using the online web server SWISS-MODEL.\n\nFindingsSequencing results shows numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms in surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1a, and ORF1ab polyprotein. While envelope, membrane, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 genes have no or few SNPs. Contigs were mto identifyn of variations in Alpha & Delta Variant of SARs-CoV-2 with reference strain (Wuhan). The secondary structures of SARs-CoV-2 proteins were predicted by using sopma software & were further compared with reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan) proteins. The tertiary structure details of only spike proteins were analyzed through the SWISS-MODEL and Ramachandran plot. By Swiss-model, a comparison of the tertiary structure model of SARS-COV-2 spike protein of Alpha & Delta Variant was made with reference strain (Wuhan).

Previous work has established an RNA modification system, RNA-TAG, in which E. coli TGT exchanges the target G on an RNA of interest for chemically modified preQ1 substrates linked to a small molecule reporter such as biotin or a fluorophore. While extending the substrate scope of RNA transglycosylases to include DNA would enable numerous applications, it has been previously reported that TGT is incapable of modifying native DNA.

Through iterative testing of rationally mutated DNA hairpin sequences, we determined the minimal sequence requirements for transglycosylation of unmodified DNA by E. coli TGT. Controlling steric constraint in the DNA hairpin dramatically affects labeling efficiency, and, when optimized, can lead to near quantitative site-specific modification.

Rhamnolipids (RLs) offer a broad range of potential applications as biosurfactants in industry and agriculture. Several studies report a high capacity for controlling different plant pests and pathogens and consider RLs as promising candidates for bio-based plant protection agents. RLs are a class of glycolipids consisting of one (mRLs) or two (dRLs) rhamnose moieties linked to a single or branched {beta}-fatty acid. Due to the diversity of RLs, so far little is known about the relation between molecular structure and biological activity.\n\nEngineering the synthesis pathway allowed us to differentiate between the activities of mixtures of pure mRL and of pure dRL congeners and elaborated HPLC techniques further enabled to analyse the activity of single congeners. In a model system with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii we demonstrate that RLs can significantly reduce infection, whereas their impact on the host plant varies depending on their molecular structure. While mRLs reduced plant growth even at low concentration, dRLs showed no or a beneficial impact on plant development. In addition, the effect of RLs on plant H2O2 production was measured as an indicator of plant defense activity. Treatment with mRLs or dRLs at a concentration of 50 ppm increased H2O2 production. Lower concentrations of up to 10 ppm were used to stimulate plants prior to a treatment with water or flagellin (flg22), a bacterial inducer of plant defense responses. At 10 ppm both mRLs and dRLs fostered an increased response to flg22. However, mRLs also led to an increased response to water, the non-inducing negative control, indicating a generally elevated stress level. Neither mRLs nor dRLs induced expression of plant defense marker genes of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways within a 1 hour and 48 hours treatment.\n\nDue to the negative effect of mRLs on plants further studies were concentrated on dRLs. Treatment of pre-parasitic infective juveniles of H. schachtii revealed that dRLs did not increase mortality even at a very high concentration of 755 ppm. In order to analyse the effect of single dRL congeners nematode infection assays were performed. While dRL congeners with a C10-C8 acyl chain increased nematode infection, dRLs with C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 acyl chains reduced nematode infection even at concentrations below 2 ppm. Plant growth was not reduced by C10-C8 dRLs, but by C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 dRLs at concentrations of 8.3 ppm. H2O2 production was increased compared to the water control upon treatment with C10-C8 dRLs at a concentration of 200 ppm, while C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 dRLs triggered the same effect already at 50 ppm.\n\nOur experiments show a clear structure-effect relation.

Calorimetry, protein engineering and biophysical modeling have outlined the fundamentals of protein stability, but these approaches face difficulties in elucidating the specific contributions of the intervening molecules and elementary interactions to the folding energy balance. Recently, we showed that, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of native proteins and their unfolded ensembles, one can calculate, within experimental error, the enthalpy and heat capacity changes of the folding reaction. Analyzing MD simulations of four model proteins (CI2, barnase, SNase and apoflavodoxin) whose folding enthalpy and heat capacity changes have been successfully calculated, we dissect here the energetic contributions to protein stability made by the different molecular players (polypeptide and solvent molecules) and elementary interactions (electrostatic, van der Waals and bonded) involved. Although the proteins analyzed differ in length (65-168 amino acid residues), isoelectric point (4.0-8.99) and overall fold, their folding energetics is governed by the same quantitative pattern. Relative to the unfolded ensemble, the native conformation is enthalpically stabilized by comparable contributions from protein-protein and solvent-solvent interactions, and it is nearly equally destabilized by interactions between protein and solvent molecules. From the perspective of elementary physical interactions, the native conformation is stabilized by van de Waals and coulombic interactions and is destabilized by bonded interactions. Also common to the four proteins, the sign of the heat capacity change is set by protein-solvent interactions or, from the alternative perspective, by coulombic interactions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/23/2023.01.23.525230"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.23.524428", "title": "Notch1 cortical signaling regulates epithelial architecture and cell-cell adhesion", "authors": "White, M.

A major limitation of this approach is that inhibitors can not restore key transcriptional activators that are mutated in many cancers, such as p53 and members of the BRAF SWI/SNF complex. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors can alter the activity of, rather than inhibit, the polycomb enzyme EZH2. While chromatin has been shown to play a major role in gene regulation in cancer, poor clinical results for polycomb chromatin-targeting therapies for diseases like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) could discourage further development of this emerging avenue for treatment. To overcome the limitations of inhibiting polycomb to study epigenetic regulation, we developed an engineered chromatin protein to manipulate transcription. The synthetic reader-actuator (SRA) is a fusion protein that directly binds a target chromatin modification and regulates gene expression. Here, we report the activity of an SRA built from polycomb chromodomain and VP64 modules that bind H3K27me3 and subunits of the Mediator complex, respectively.

Despite the widespread use of certain in vitro models, many still lack contemporary genomic analysis supporting their use as a proxy for the affected human cells and tissues. Consequently, it is imperative to determine how accurately and effectively any proposed biological surrogate may reflect the biological processes it is assumed to model. One such cellular surrogate of human disease is the established mouse neural precursor cell line, SN4741, which has been used to elucidate mechanisms of neurotoxicity in Parkinson disease for over 25 years. Here, we are using a combination of classic and contemporary genomic techniques - karyotyping, RT-qPCR, single cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq - to characterize the transcriptional landscape, chromatin landscape, and genomic architecture of this cell line, and evaluate its suitability as a proxy for midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the study of Parkinson disease. We find that SN4741 cells possess an unstable triploidy and consistently exhibits low expression of dopaminergic neuron markers across assays, even when the cell line is shifted to the non-permissive temperature that drives differentiation. The transcriptional signatures of SN4741 cells suggest that they are maintained in an undifferentiated state at the permissive temperature and differentiate into immature neurons at the non-permissive temperature; however, they may not be dopaminergic neuron precursors, as previously suggested. Additionally, the chromatin landscapes of SN4741 cells, in both the differentiated and undifferentiated states, are not concordant with the open chromatin profiles of ex vivo, mouse E15.5 forebrain- or midbrain-derived dopaminergic neurons. Overall, our data suggest that SN4741 cells may reflect early aspects of neuronal differentiation but are likely not a suitable a proxy for dopaminergic neurons as previously thought.

These studies have predominantly been conducted in individuals of European ancestries, which raises questions about their transferability to individuals of other ancestries. Of particular interest are admixed populations, usually defined as populations with recent ancestry from two or more continental sources. Admixed genomes contain segments of distinct ancestries that vary in composition across individuals in the population, allowing for the same allele to induce risk for disease on different ancestral backgrounds. This mosaicism raises unique challenges for GWAS in admixed populations, such as the need to correctly adjust for population stratification to balance type I error with statistical power. In this work we quantify the impact of differences in estimated allelic effect sizes for risk variants between ancestry backgrounds on association statistics. Specifically, while the possibility of estimated allelic effect-size heterogeneity by ancestry (HetLanc) can be modeled when performing GWAS in admixed populations, the extent of HetLanc needed to overcome the penalty from an additional degree of freedom in the association statistic has not been thoroughly quantified. Using extensive simulations of admixed genotypes and phenotypes we find that modeling HetLanc in its absence reduces statistical power by up to 72%. This finding is especially pronounced in the presence of allele frequency differentiation. We replicate simulation results using 4,327 African-European admixed genomes from the UK Biobank for 12 traits to find that for most significant SNPs HetLanc is not large enough for GWAS to benefit from modeling heterogeneity.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2023.01.20.524946"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525309", "title": "Crb3 stabilizes activated Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin to organize the apical domain of multiciliated cells", "authors": "Burckle, C.; Raitiere, J.; Kodjabachian, L.; Le-Bivic, A.", "author_corresponding": "Celine Burckle", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institute Genetics and Development of Rennes (IGDR)", "date": "2023-01-24", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Cell shape changes mainly rely on the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

Using morpholino-mediated knockdown, we show that Crb3.L-depleted MCCs display a complex phenotype associating reduction in the apical surface, disorganization of the apical actin meshwork, centriole/BB migration defects, as well as abnormal ciliary tuft formation. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that Crb3.L could regulate Ezrin-Radixin Moesin (ERM) protein subcellular localization in MCCs. Strikingly, we observed that endogenous phospho-activated ERM (pERM) is recruited to the growing apical domain of inserting MCCs, in a Crb3.L-dependent manner.

Five cryo-EM structures of the CRISPR trimmer-integrase, visualized both before and during DNA integration, show how asymmetric processing generates size-defined, PAM-containing substrates.

This activation is typically short-lived, as channel opening is followed by a rapid and spontaneous pore closure due to a process termed fast desensitization. This intrinsic channel closing mechanism is important, because excessive activation of ASICs during periods of prolonged acidosis in conditions such as inflammation and ischemia, has been linked to several pathologies, including pain and stroke. Structural and functional data suggest that a conserved lysine in the ECD (Lys211 in mASIC1a) plays a role in receptor function. However, the precise physico-chemical contributions to activation and fast desensitization are difficult to dissect with conventional mutagenesis, as replacement of Lys211 with naturally occurring side chains invariably changes multiple parameters, such as size, charge, and H-bonding pattern simultaneously. Here, we study the contribution of Lys211 to activation and fast desensitization of mASIC1a using tandem protein-trans splicing (tPTS) to incorporate non-canonical lysine analogs. We conduct extensive optimization efforts to improve apparent splicing yields and subsequently interrogate the function of semisynthetic mASIC1a using two-electrode voltage clamp. Our data show that both charge and side chain length of Lys211 are crucial to activation and fast desensitization of mASIC1a, with the latter being sensitive to even the most subtle mutational disruptions.

The ProT-VAE latent space exposes ancestral and functional relationships that enable conditional generation of novel sequences with high functionality and substantial sequence diversity.

How the structure of the nucleolus is maintained and regulated is poorly understood. Here, we identified two types of nucleoli in C. elegans. Type I nucleoli are spherical, and rRNA transcription and processing factors are evenly distributed throughout the nucleolus. In type II nucleoli, rRNA transcription and processing factors exclusively accumulate in the periphery rim, which is named the nucleolar ring. The hollow vacuole inside the nucleolar ring contains proteins that usually localize in the nucleoplasm but are capable of exchanging contents across the ring. The high-order structure of the nucleolus is dynamically regulated in C. elegans. Faithful rRNA processing is important to maintain the spherical structure of the nucleoli. The depletion of a class of rRNA processing factors, for example, class I ribosomal proteins of the large subunit (RPL), which are involved in 27SA2 rRNA processing, reshaped spherical nucleoli to a ring-shaped nucleolar structure. The inhibition of RNAP I transcription and depletion of two conserved nucleolar factors, nucleolin and fibrillarin, prohibits the formation of the nucleolar ring. We concluded that the integrity of nucleoli is highly dependent on rRNA processing and maturation, which may provide a mechanism to coordinate structure maintenance and gene expression.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2023.01.23.525268"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.23.525218", "title": "Endothelial vacuole membrane enriched aquaporins regulate microvascular lumenization in development and hyperglycemia", "authors": "Chen, C.; Qin, Y.; Xu, Y.; Chen, L.; Wang, L.; Liu, D.", "author_corresponding": "Dong Liu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Nantong University", "date": "2023-01-24", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "In patients with diabetic microvascular complications, reduced vessel perfusion or vascular occlusion is a common characteristic which will cause the insufficient blood supply.

Taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish, we observed the reduction of vascular diameter and compromised perfusion in high glucose treated embryos. RNA sequencing and whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis indicated that two aquaporins (aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1) were significant down-regulated, which was further confirmed by endothelial specific Q-PCR. It was also shown that the two aqps were spatio-temporally enriched in the endothelial cells (ECs) of vascular system. Zebrafish with loss of aqp1a.1 or aqp8a.1 displayed lumenization defects in intersegmental vessels, recapitulating the phenotype in hyperglycemic zebrafish model. While overexpressing the aquaporins in zebrafish promoted the enlargement of the vascular diameter. Moreover, the defective vasculature induced by high-glucose treatment could be rescued by aqp1a.1 upregulation. In addition, both aqp1a.1 and apq8a.1 were localized in the intracellular vacuoles in cultured ECs as well as in the ECs of sprouting ISVs, and loss of Aqps caused the reduction of those vacuoles, which was required for lumenization. Finally, we found that the expression of human AQP1 was downregulated in diabetic human retina samples and high-glucose treated human retinal microvascular endothelial cells.

At the apex of this massive and constant blood production lie hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), a rare cell type harboring unique self-renewal and multipotent properties. A key feature of HSCs is their ability to temporarily exit the cell cycle in a state termed quiescence. Defective control of cell cycle progression can eventually lead to bone marrow failure or malignant transformation. Recent work in embryonic stem cells has suggested that cells can more robustly respond to differentiation cues in the early phases of the cell cycle, owing to a discrete chromatin state permissive to cell fate commitment. However, the molecular mechanisms tying cell cycle re-entry to cell fate commitment in adult stem cells such as HSCs remain elusive. Here, we report that the chromatin-associated Sin3B protein is necessary for HSCs commitment to differentiation, but dispensable for their self-renewal or survival. Transcriptional profiling of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) genetically inactivated for Sin3B at the single cell level reveals aberrant cell cycle gene expression, correlating with the defective engagement of discrete signaling programs. In particular, the loss of Sin3B in the hematopoietic compartment results in aberrant expression of cell adhesion molecules and essential components of the interferon signaling cascade in LT-HSCs. Finally, chromatin accessibility profiling in LT-HSCs suggests a link between Sin3B-dependent cell cycle progression and priming of hematopoietic stem cells for differentiation. Together, these results point to controlled progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle as a likely regulator of HSC lineage commitment through the modulation of chromatin features.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2023.01.23.525185"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.23.525017", "title": "Robust and fast multicolor Single Molecule Localization Microscopy using spectral separation and demixing", "authors": "Friedl, K.; Mau, A.; Caorsi, V.; Bourg, N.; Leveque-Fort, S.; Leterrier, C.", "author_corresponding": "Christophe Leterrier", "author_corresponding_institution": "Aix Marseille Universite CNRS, INP UMR7051, NeuroCyto, Marseille, France", "date": "2023-01-24", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is a straightforward approach to reach sub-50 nm resolution using techniques such as Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) or DNA-Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT), and to resolve the arrangement of cellular components in their native environment.

Subsequently, we identify the parameters for the ten weeks (weeks 40-50, 2014) of process data from North Water WWTP with prior parameters from the recommended ones from IWA. We further established a subset of parameters that are correlated to NGS data. Based on this relationship, a parameter-varying mod-ASM1 is obtained where the parameter variation is directly linked to the NGS data. We validate the NGS-enriched mod-ASM1 in the prediction of process data in the subsequent three weeks (weeks 50-53, 2014). While the enriched mod-ASM1 gives a good estimation of the COD effluent data, it cannot capture the production of nitrogen, which is often missed when the static model is deployed.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/24/2023.01.23.523537"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525266", "title": "Endothelial tissue remodeling induced by intraluminal pressure enhances paracellular solute transport", "authors": "Cacheux, J.; Bancaud, A.; Alcaide, D.; Suehiro, J.-i.; Akimoto, Y.; Sakurai, H.; Matsunaga, Y.

Upon application of an intraluminal pressure of 100 Pa, we demonstrate that the flow through the tissue increases by 135%.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the golden-standard technique for diagnosing this brain disorder and has played an essential role in epilepsy monitoring and disease management. It is extremely laborious and challenging, if not practical, for physicians and expert humans to annotate all recorded signals, particularly in long-term monitoring. The annotation process often involves identifying signal segments with suspected epileptic seizure features or other abnormalities and/or known healthy features. Therefore, automated epilepsy detection becomes a key clinical need because it can greatly improve clinical practice's efficiency and free up human expert time to attend to other important tasks. Current automated seizure detection algorithms generally face two challenges: (1) models trained for specific patients, but such models are patient-specific, hence fail to generalize to other patients and real-world situations; (2) seizure detection models trained on large EEG datasets have low sensitivity and/or high false positive rates, often with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) that is not high enough for potential clinical applicability. This paper proposes Transformers for Seizure Detection, which we refer to as TSD in this manuscript. A Transformer is a deep learning architecture based on an encoder-decoder structure and on attention mechanisms, which we apply to recorded brain signals. The AUROC of our proposed model has achieved 92.1%, tested with Temple University's publically available electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure corpus dataset (TUH). Additionally, we highlight the impact of input domains on the model's performance. Specifically, TSD performs best in identifying epileptic seizures when the input domain is a time-frequency. Finally, our proposed model for seizure detection in inference-only mode with EEG recordings shows outstanding performance in classifying seizure types and superior model initialization.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525308"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525327", "title": "Recovery of protein synthesis to measure transcription-coupled DNA repair in living cells and tissues", "authors": "van der Woude, M.; Davo-Martinez, C.; Thijssen, K.

We study the mosquito response to the infection at three critical stages of parasite development: formation of ookinetes at 24 hours post-infection (hpi), the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel at 10 days post-infection (dpi), and storage of sporozoites in the salivary glands at 21dpi. For each time point, we characterized the gene expression of mosquitoes infected with each P. relictum and P. cathemerium and mosquitoes fed on an uninfected bird and, subsequently, compared their transcriptomic responses. Differential gene expression analysis showed most of the transcriptomic changes occurred during the early infection stage (24 hpi), especially when comparing P. relictum and P. cathemerium infected mosquitoes. Differentially expressed genes in mosquitoes infected with each species were related mainly to the immune response, trypsin, and other serine-proteases metabolism.

It has been implicated in several diseases such as congenital anomalies of the kidney where its activity is diminished and cancer where it participates in oncogenic fusion protein events. ZMYM2 is thought to function through promoting transcriptional repression and here we provide more evidence to support this designation. We demonstrate that ZMYM2 is part of distinct chromatin-bound complexes including the established LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex and identify new functional and physical interactions with ADNP and TRIM28/KAP1. The ZMYM2-TRIM28 complex forms in a SUMO-dependent manner and is associated with repressive chromatin. ZMYM2 and TRIM28 show strong functional similarity and co-regulate a large number of genes. However, there are no strong links between ZMYM2-TRIM28 binding events and nearby individual gene regulation. Instead, ZMYM2-TRIM28 appears to regulate genes in a more regionally defined manner within TADs where it can directly regulate co-associated retrotransposon expression. We find that different types of ZMYM2 binding complex associate with and regulate distinct subclasses of retrotransposons, with ZMYM2-ADNP complexes at SINEs and ZMYM2-TRIM28 complexes at LTR elements.

In vertebrate FIS1 this insert is serine (S45), lysine (K46), and tyrosine (Y47). To determine the biological role of this SKY insert, three variants were evaluated for their fold, and tested in HCT116 cells for altered mitochondrial morphology and recruitment of effectors, DRP1 and TBC1D15. Substitution of the SKY insert with three alanine residues (AAA), or deletion of the insert ({Delta}SKY), did not substantially alter the fold or thermal stability of the protein.

Here, we investigate the function of Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 voltage-gated Ca2+ channel in tendon formation. Using a reporter mouse line, we first demonstrated that the endogenous CaV1.2 L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel is highly expressed in tendons during development and downregulated in adult homeostasis. To assess its function, we generated ScxCre;CaV1.2TS mice that express a gain-of-function mutant CaV1.2 channel (G406R, CaV1.2TS) in tendon. We found that tendons in the mutant mice were approximately 2/3 larger and had more tendon fibroblasts, but the cell density of the mutant mice decreased by around 22%. TEM analyses demonstrated increased collagen fibrillogenesis in the hypertrophic tendon. Biomechanical testing revealed that the hypertrophic Achilles tendons display higher peak load and stiffness, with no changes in peak stress and elastic modulus. Proteomics analysis reveals no significant difference in the abundance of major extracellular matrix (ECM) type I and III collagens, but mutant mice had about a 2-fold increase in other ECM proteins such as tenascin C, tenomodulin, periostin, type XIV and type VIII collagens, around 11-fold increase in the growth factor of TGF-{beta} family myostatin, and significant elevation of matrix remodeling proteins including Mmp14, Mmp2, and cathepsin K.

Joint size increased throughout age, yet barrows had smaller joints than boars (p<0.001 for all measures). ACL cross-sectional area (CSA), length, volume, and stiffness all increased with age (p<0.0001), as did ACL anteromedial (AM) bundle percent contribution to resisting applied loads (p=0.012). Boar ACL and AM bundle volumes were 18% (p=0.003) and 24% (p=0.004) larger than barrows across ages. However, CSA, stiffness, and bundle contribution were similar between boars and barrows (p>0.05).

To investigate the antioxidant activity in vitro (aqueous and hydroethanolic extracts in vivo (of the 55% hydroethanolic extract) of Dracaena deisteliana leaves in albino rats of Wistar strain previously infected with the Salmonella strain Typhi ATCC 6539. The in vitro antioxidant activity of these extracts was determined by studying their anti-radical power with DPPH*, then their iron-reducing power and determining their flavonoids and total phenols content. In vivo antioxidant activity was determined in plasma and tissues of albino rats of wistar strain aged between 8 and 10 weeks previously infected with Salmonella typhi ATCC 6539. These infected rats concurrently received daily doses of Dracaena deisteliana extract (10, 20 and 51.84 mg/kg) or ciprofloxacin (14 mg/kg) as positive control, for 15 days. At the end of the treatment period, the animals were sacrificed and blood, liver, kidney, heart, lung, spleen testis and ovaris were collected for evaluation of antioxidants parameters, which included malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, catalase and peroxidase, as well as biological responses. Regarding in vitro antioxidant tests, the 65% hydroethanolic extract showed an anti-radical activity with DPPH* superior to that of all hydroethanolic extracts at 100 g/ml. However, the infused showed lower antiradical activity than all extracts at 12.5 and 200 g/ml concentrations. The 55% hydroethanolic extract had the best IC50of (11.99 g/ml). The iron reducing power of this extract was higher than the other extracts at 200 g/ml. The highest levels of flavonoids and total phenols were obtained respectively with the 55% and 95% hydroethanolic extract. The hydroethanol extract of Dracaena deisteliana (10, 20 and 51.84 mg/kg) cured the infected rats between the 9th and 13th day of treatment. The extract also significantly reduced (p < 0.05) blood malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels, and significantly increased (p >0.05) the activity of catalase and peroxidase in the infected rats. The results suggest that leaves extract of Dracaena deisteliana contains antisalmonella and antioxidant substances, which could be used for the treatment of typhoid fever and another salmonellosis. In addition, 55% hydroethanolic extract of this plant possesses antisalmonella activity and reduces the state of oxidative stress caused by S. typhi during rat's infection.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525426"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525446", "title": "The Impact of Species Tree Estimation Error on Cophylogenetic Reconstruction", "authors": "Zheng, J.; Nishida, Y.; Okrasinska, A.; Bonito, G.

The most widely used cophylogenetic reconstruction methods utilize an important simplifying assumption: species phylogenies for each set of coevolved taxa are required as input and assumed to be correct. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown that this assumption is rarely -- if ever -- satisfied, and the consequences for cophylogenetic studies are poorly understood. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive performance study that quantifies the relationship between species tree estimation error and downstream cophylogenetic estimation accuracy.

Little emphasis has been placed, however, on the fundamentals of the DNA-sediment associations and, consequently, our understanding of taphonomy and provenance of eDNA in sediments remains extremely limited. If we are to be able to accurately infer community dynamics across time and space from eDNA data, we need to understand how depositional processes and sedimentary associations of DNA molecules in different settings influence our interpretation. Approach and methods: Here, we introduce interfacial geochemical principles to the field of eDNA and discuss current interpretational biases. We outline a way to increase the scope and resolution of ecological interpretations from eDNA by combining mineralogic composition with experimental adsorption data. We apply distribution coefficients to assess the relationship between the DNA fraction in water columns and DNA fraction sequestered by suspended sediment particles. We further evaluate the challenges with drawing ecological inference using eDNA from sedimentary systems that receive input from different ecosystem types as a consequence of sedimentary processes. Main results: We show that: The retention of DNA in aqueous environments depends on the mineralogy of sediment particles and on the number of particles loaded in the water column. DNA attached to sediment particles from distal systems can be deposited in proximal systems and skew the interpretation of the proximal sediment samples. High particle loading in the water column can deplete suspended DNA and cause inaccurate interpretation of aqueous DNA samples. High particle loading in surface sediment pore waters enhances sequestration of DNA from benthic communities relative to that of water column communities, resulting in skewed estimates of species richness and abundance from sedimentary DNA. We discuss how to integrate taphonomy and provenance knowledge into the reconstruction of modern and past ecosystems, and ecosystem monitoring from eDNA data.

Adaptive resistance is a major form of drug resistance, wherein the rewiring of protein signalling networks in response to drug perturbation allows the drug-targeted protein's activity to recover, despite the continuous presence of the drug, enabling the cells to survive/grow. Simultaneously, molecular heterogeneity enables the selection of drug-resistant cancer clones that can survive an initial drug insult, proliferate, and eventually cause disease relapse. Despite their importance, the link between heterogeneity and adaptive resistance, specifically how heterogeneity influences protein signalling dynamics to drive adaptive resistance, remains poorly understood. Here, we have explored the relationship between heterogeneity, protein signalling dynamics and adaptive resistance through the development of a novel modelling technique coined Meta Dynamic Network (MDN) modelling. We use MDN modelling to characterise how heterogeneity influences the drug-response signalling dynamics of the proteins that regulate early cell cycle progression and demonstrate that heterogeneity can robustly facilitate adaptive resistance associated dynamics for key cell cycle regulators. We determined the influence of heterogeneity at the level of both protein interactions and protein expression and show that protein interactions are a much stronger driver of adaptive resistance. Owing to the mechanistic nature of the underpinning ODE framework, we then identified a full spectrum of subnetworks that drive adaptive resistance dynamics in the key early cell cycle regulators. Finally, we show that single-cell dynamic data supports the validity of our MDN modelling technique and a comparison between our predicted resistance mechanisms and known CDK4/6 and Estrogen Receptor inhibitor resistance mechanisms suggests MDN can be deployed to robustly predict network-level resistance mechanisms for novel drugs and additional protein signalling networks.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525460"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525366", "title": "Intestinal Paneth cell differentiation relies on asymmetric regulation of Wnt signaling by Daam1/2", "authors": "Colozza, G.; Lee, H.; Merenda, A.; Wu, S.-H.; Catala-Bordes, A.; Radaszkiewicz, T.; Jordens, I.; Lee, J.-H.; Bamford, A.-D.; Farnhammer, F.; Low, T.

However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell-friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, for the first time, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel-based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non-transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds into the volumetric printing process, high-resolution bioprinted structures were successfully achieved. Tensile, burst and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes were tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi-material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof-of-concept, engineered vessel-like structures were obtained by building tri-layered cell-laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that could be resolved only by synergizing these printing methods. This multi-technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi-material living structures.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525418"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525466", "title": "Interleg coordination is not strictly controlled during walking", "authors": "Arai, T.; Ota, K.; Funato, T.; Tsuchiya, K.; Aoyagi, T.; Aoi, S.", "author_corresponding": "Shinya Aoi", "author_corresponding_institution": "Osaka University", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "In human walking, the left and right legs move alternately, half a stride out of phase with each other. Although various parameters, such as stride frequency, stride length, and duty factor, vary with walking speed, the antiphase relationship of the leg motion remains unchanged. This is the case even during running. However, during walking in left-right asymmetric situations, such as walking with unilateral leg loading, walking along a curved path, and walking on a split-belt treadmill, the relative phase between left and right leg motion shifts from the antiphase condition to compensate for the asymmetry. In addition, the phase relationship fluctuates significantly during walking of elderly people and patients with neurological disabilities, such as those caused by stroke or Parkinson's disease. These observations suggest that appropriate interleg coordination is important for adaptive walking and that interleg coordination is strictly controlled during walking of healthy young people. However, the control mechanism of interleg coordination remains unclear. In the present study, we derive a quantity that models the control of interleg coordination during walking of healthy young people by taking advantage of a state-of-the-art method that combines big data science with nonlinear dynamics. This is done by modeling this control as the interaction between two coupled oscillators through the phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference method. However, the results were not what we expected. Specifically, we found that the relative phase between the motion of the legs is not actively controlled until the deviation from the antiphase condition exceeds a certain threshold. In other words, the control of interleg coordination has a dead zone like that in the case of the steering wheel of an automobile. Such forgoing of control presumably enhances energy efficiency and maneuverability during walking. Furthermore, the forgoing of control in specific situations, where we expect strict control, also appears in quiet standing. This suggests that interleg coordination in walking and quiet standing have a common characteristic strategy. Our discovery of the dead zone in the control of interleg coordination not only provides useful insight for understanding gait control in humans, but also should lead to the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in gait adaptation and disorders through further investigation of the dead zone.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525466"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525448", "title": "The Multi-State Epigenetic Pacemaker enables the identification of combinations of factors that influence DNA methylation", "authors": "Farrell, C.; Lapborisuth, K.; Snir, S.; Pellegrini, M.", "author_corresponding": "Matteo Pellegrini", "author_corresponding_institution": "UCLA", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks, DNA methylation based predictive models of chronological age, are often utilized to study aging associated biology. Despite their widespread use, these methods do not account for other factors that also contribute to the variability of DNA methylation data. For example, many CpG sites show strong sex-specific or cell type specific patterns that likely impact the predictions of epigenetic age. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multidimensional extension of the Epigenetic Pacemaker, the Multi-State Epigenetic Pacemaker (MSEPM). We show that the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation associated factors simultaneously, while also providing site specific models that describe the per site relationship between methylation and these factors. We utilized the MSEPM with a large aggregate cohort of blood methylation data to construct models of the effects of age, sex and cell type heterogeneity on DNA methylation. We found that these models capture a large faction of the variability at thousands of DNA methylation sites. Moreover, we found modeled sites that are primarily affected by aging and no other factors. Among these, those that lose methylation over time are enriched for CTCF transcription factor chip peaks, while those that gain methylation over time are enriched for REST transcription factor chip peaks. Both transcription factors are associated with transcriptional maintenance and suggest a general dysregulation of transcription with age that is not impacted by sex or cell type heterogeneity. In conclusion, the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation associated factors and the models produced can illuminate site specific combinations of factors that affect methylation dynamics.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525448"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.24.525411", "title": "in vivo quantitative FRET small animal imaging: intensity versus lifetime-based FRET", "authors": "Smith, J.

In this paper, we show that the hearts of mice with deletion of Sirt2 (Sirt2-/-) display improved cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and pressure overload (PO), suggesting that SIRT2 exerts maladaptive effects in the heart in response to stress. Similar results were obtained in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt2 deletion. Mechanistic studies suggest that SIRT2 modulates cellular levels and activity of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), which results in reduced expression of antioxidant proteins. Deletion of Nrf2 in the hearts of Sirt2-/- mice reversed protection after PO. Finally, treatment of mouse hearts with a specific SIRT2 inhibitors reduces cardiac size and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in response to PO. These data indicate that SIRT2 has detrimental effects in the heart and plays a role in the progression of HF and cardiac hypertrophy, which makes this protein a unique member of the SIRT family.

Employing TDC instead of FRET mostly affects the EET between chlorophylls (Chls) and carotenoids (Crts), as expected due to the Crts being spatially more challenging for FRET. Only between Chls, effects are found to be small (about only 0.1 EET efficiency change when introducing TDC instead of FRET). Effects of structural sampling were found to be small, illustrated by a small average standard deviation for the Qy state coupling elements (FRET/TDC: 0.97/0.94 cm-1). Due to the higher flexibility of the Bx state, the corresponding deviations are larger (FRET/TDC between Chl-Chl pairs: 17.58/22.67 cm-1, between Crt-Chl pairs: 62.58/31.63 cm-1). In summary, it was found for the Q band that the coupling between Chls varies only slightly depending on FRET or TDC, resulting in a minute effect on EET acceptor preference. In contrast, the coupling in the B band spectral region is found to be more affected. Here, the S2 (1Bu) states of the spatially challenging Crts may act as acceptors in addition to the Chl B states. Depending on FRET or TDC, several Chls show different Chl-to-Crt couplings. Interestingly, the EET between Chls or Crts in the B band is found to often outcompete the corresponding decay processes.

We built a cohort using electronic health records (EHR) of consented patients with available samples, and then performed high-throughput whole-genome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of key genes responsible for HF and other CVD pathologies. We also incorporated a translational aspect to our study by integrating genomics findings with patient medical records. This involved linking ICD-10 codes with our gene expression and variant data to identify associations with HF and other CVDs. Our in-depth gene expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes associated with HF (41 genes) and other CVDs (23 genes). Furthermore, a variant analysis of whole-genome sequence data of CVD patients identified genes with altered gene expression (FLNA, CST3, LGALS3, and HBA1) with functional and nonfunctional mutations in these genes. Our study highlights the importance of an integrative approach that leverages gene expression, genetic mutations, and clinical data that will allow the prioritization of key driver genes for complex diseases to improve personalized healthcare.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.24.525457"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.25.525554", "title": "Small Molecule Activation of NAPE-PLD Enhances Efferocytosis by Macrophages", "authors": "Zarrow, J.

Several lines of evidence suggest that reduced NAPE-PLD activity could contribute to cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, NAPEPLD expression is reduced in human coronary arteries with unstable atherosclerotic lesions, defective efferocytosis is implicated in the enlargement of necrotic cores of these lesions, and NAPE-PLD products such as palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide have been shown to enhance efferocytosis. Thus, enzyme activation mediated by a small molecule may serve as a therapeutic treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. As a proof-of-concept study, we sought to identify small molecule activators of NAPE-PLD. High-throughput screening followed by hit validation and primary lead optimization studies identified a series of benzothiazole phenylsulfonyl-piperidine carboxamides that variably increased activity of both mouse and human NAPE-PLD. From this set of small molecules, two NAPE-PLD activators (VU534 and VU533) were shown to increase efferocytosis by bone-marrow derived macrophages isolated from wild-type mice, while efferocytosis was significantly reduced in Napepld-/- BMDM or after Nape-pld inhibition.

So far, there was no evidence of tissue-specific regulation of P4H, nor of a differential substrate repertoire of P4HAs. Here, the post-translational modifications of collagen extracted from bone, skin, and tendon were compared, revealing lower hydroxylation of most GEP/GDP triplets, together with fewer other residue positions along collagen  chains, in the tendon. This regulation is mostly conserved in two distant homeotherm species, mouse and chicken. The comparison of detailed P4H patterns in both species suggests a dual mechanism of specificity. P4ha2 expression is low in tendon and its genetic invalidation in the ATDC5 cellular model of collagen assembly specifically mimics the tendon-related P4H profile.

However, the structure prediction of multi-domain proteins remains a challenge. Achieving end-to-end protein domain assembly and further improving the accuracy of the full-chain modelling by accurately predicting inter-domain orientation while improving the assembly efficiency will provide significant insights into structure-based drug discovery. In addition, the available GPU memory limits the size of a full-chain protein which can be predicted. Based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, the single-domain structure is predicted by the state-of-the-art prediction method, such as AlphaFold2, and then assembled into a full-chain model through the domain assembly method, which can effectively reduce the demand for hardware resources. In this work, we propose an End-To-End Domain Assembly method based on deep learning, named E2EDA. We first develop an EffificientNetV2-based deep learning model (RMNet), which is specialised for predicting inter-domain orientations. The RMNet uses an attention mechanism to predict inter-domain rigid motion by fusing sequence features, multiple template features and single-domain features. Then, the predicted rigid motions are converted into inter-domain spatial transformations to assemble full-chain models of multi-domain proteins directly without time-consuming simulation processes. Finally, a scoring strategy, RMscore, is designed to select the best model from multiple assembled models to improve assembly accuracy. The experimental results show that the average TM-score of the model assembled by E2EDA on the benchmark set (356) is 0.84, which is better than other domain assembly methods SADA (0.80), DEMO (0.74) and AIDA (0.63). Meanwhile, on our constructed human protein dataset from AlphaFold DB, the model reassembled by E2EDA is 6.8% higher than the full-chain model predicted by AlphaFold2, indicating that E2EDA can capture more accurate inter-domain orientations to improve the quality of the model predicted by AlphaFold2. Furthermore, the average running time of E2EDA on the benchmark is reduced by 74.6% compared with the domain assembly simulation method SADA, which indicates that E2EDA can effectively improve assembly efficiency through an end-to-end manner.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.25.525481"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.25.525430", "title": "Mechanism of HflX-mediated recycling of E. coli ribosome studied by time-resolved cryo-EM", "authors": "Bhattacharjee, S.; Frank, J.; Feng, X.", "author_corresponding": "Joachim Frank", "author_corresponding_institution": "Columbia University", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Recycling of stalled, translationally inactive ribosomes is one of the response mechanisms underlying resistance to environmental stress.

Prediction of shifts, and therefore interpretation of shifts, particularly for the frequently measured amidic 15N sites, remains a tall challenge. We demonstrate that protein 15N chemical shift prediction from QM/MM predictions can be improved if conformational variation is included via MD sampling, focusing on the antibiotic target, E. coli Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Variations of up to 25 ppm in predicted 15N chemical shifts are observed over the trajectory. For solution shifts the average of fluctuations on the low picosecond timescale results in a superior prediction to a single optimal conformation. For low temperature solid state measurements, the histogram of predicted shifts for locally minimized snapshots with specific solvent arrangements sampled from the trajectory explains the heterogeneous linewidths; in other words, the conformations and associated solvent are frozen out at low temperatures and result in inhomogeneously broadened NMR peaks. We identified conformational degrees of freedom that contribute to chemical shift variation. Backbone torsion angles show high amplitude fluctuations during the trajectory on the low picosecond timescale. For a number of residues, including I60, Psi varies by up to 60 degrees within a conformational basin during the MD simulations, despite the fact that I60 (and other sites studied) are in a secondary structure element and remain well folded during the trajectory. Fluctuations in Psi appear to be compensated by other degrees of freedom in the protein, including Phi of the succeeding residue, resulting in rocking of the amide plane with changes in hydrogen bonding interactions.

Among 3-phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) remains the least understood species in terms of its spatiotemporal dynamics and physiological function due to the lack of specific probes. By means of spatiotemporally resolved in situ quantitative imaging of PI(3,5)P2 using a newly developed ratiometric PI(3,5)P2 sensor we demonstrate that a special pool of PI(3,5)P2 is generated on lysosomes and late endosomes in response to growth factor stimulation. This PI(3,5)P2 pool, the formation of which is mediated by Class II PI3KC2{beta} and PIKFyve, plays a crucial role in terminating the activity of growth factor-stimulated Class I PI3K, one of the most frequently mutated proteins in cancer, via specific interaction with its regulatory p85 subunit.

TIA1 contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are capable of binding nucleic acids and a C-terminal Q/N-rich prion-related domain (PRD) which has been variously described as intrinsically disordered or prion inducing and is believed to play a role in promoting liquid-liquid phase separation connected with the assembly of stress granule formation. Motivated by the fact that our prior work shows RRMs 2 and 3 are well-ordered in an oligomeric full-length form, while RRM1 and the PRD appear to phase separate, the present work addresses whether the oligomeric form is functional and competent for binding, and probes the consequences of nucleic acid binding for oligomerization and protein conformation change. New SSNMR data show that ssDNA binds to full-length oligomeric TIA1 primarily at the RRM2 domain, but also weakly at the RRM3 domain, and Zn2+ binds primarily to RRM3. Binding of Zn2+ and DNA was reversible for the full-length wild type oligomeric form, and did not lead to formation of amyloid fibrils, despite the presence of the C-terminal prion-related domain. While TIA1:DNA complexes appear as long daisy chained structures, the addition of Zn2+ caused the structures to collapse. We surmise that this points to a regulatory role for Zn2+. By occupying various half binding sites on RRM3, Zn2+ may shift the nucleic acid binding off RRM3 and onto RRM2.

Cell-based assays suggest that Ndel1/Nde1 also work with Lis1 to promote dynein activation, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Using purified proteins and quantitative binding assays, we found that Ndel1's C-terminal region contributes to binding to dynein and negatively regulates binding to Lis1.

We found that phosphomimetic mutations in Ndel1's C-terminal domain increase its ability to inhibit dynein-dynactin-adaptor complex formation. Second, we observed that Ndel1 interacts with dynein and Lis1 simultaneously and sequesters Lis1 away from its dynein binding site. In doing this, Ndel1 prevents Lis1-mediated dynein activation. Our work suggests that in vitro, Ndel1 is a negative regulator of dynein activation, which contrasts with cellular studies where Ndel1 promotes dynein activity.

In separate simulations, we show that three examined peptides exhibit similar insertion and adsorption behaviors when interacting with POPC bilayers, confirming that peptide-induced perturbations to POPC in conjugates and bilayers are similar in nature and magnitude. Furthermore, we observed correlations between the peptide-induced structural perturbations and the near-infrared emission of the lipid-functionalized SWNTs, which suggest that the optical signal of the conjugates transduces the morphological changes in the lipid corona. Overall, our findings indicate that lipid-functionalized SWNTs could serve as simplified cell membrane model systems for pre-screening of new antimicrobial compounds that disrupt cell membranes.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.25.525557"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.25.525547", "title": "Hsf1 and the molecular chaperone Hsp90 support a \"rewiring stress response\" leading to an adaptive cell size increase in chronic stress", "authors": "Maiti, S.; Bhattacharya, K.; Wider, D.; Hany, D.; Panasenko, O.; Bernasconi, L.; Hulo, N.; Picard, D.", "author_corresponding": "Didier Picard", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Geneva", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Cells are exposed to a wide variety of internal and external stresses. Whereas many studies have focused on cellular responses to acute and severe stresses, little is known about how cellular systems adapt to sublethal chronic stresses. Using mammalian cells in culture, we discovered that they adapt to chronic mild stress by increasing their size and translation, thereby scaling the amount of total protein. These adaptations render them more resilient to persistent and subsequent stresses. We demonstrate that Hsf1, well known for its role in acute stress responses, is required for the cell size increase, and that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for coupling the cell size increase to augmented translation. We term this translational reprogramming the \"rewiring stress response\", and propose that this protective process of chronic stress adaptation contributes to the increase in size as cells get older, and that its failure promotes aging.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.25.525547"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.01.25.525516", "title": "Engineering synthetic CopT/A-based genetic circuits for miRNA imaging and functional gene regulation", "authors": "Zhang, C.; Shi, X.; Tang, C.; Du, Y.; Shu, W.; Wang, F.", "author_corresponding": "Fu Wang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Xi'an Jiaotong  University", "date": "2023-01-25", "category": "synthetic biology", "abstract": "Synthetic genetic circuits that can operate at the transcriptional and translation levels have been widely applied in the control of cellular behaviors and functions. However, the regulation of genetic circuits is often accompanied by the introduction of exogenous substances or the endogenous generation of inhibitory products, which would bring uncontrollable hazards for biological safety and reduce the efficiency of the system. Here, we described a miRNA-responsive CopT-CopA (miCop) genetic circuit system to realize real-time monitoring the intracellular expression of miRNA-124a during neurogenesis or miRNA-122 under the stimulation of extracellular drugs in living cells and animals. Furthermore, to prove the modularity of the system, we engineered this mipCop to tune the expression of DTA (diphtheria toxin A) gene, and showed the powerful capacity of killing cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest based on miRNA response. This study provides an effective means to couple miRNA sensing with miRNA-responsive gene modulation, which may open up new diagnostic or therapeutic applications.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2023/01/25/2023.01.25.525516"}]
