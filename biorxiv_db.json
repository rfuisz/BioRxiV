If ribosomes stall for prolonged times, cells suffer due to the loss of translating ribosomes and the accumulation of aberrant protein products. Thus to protect cells, stalled ribosomes experience a series of reactions to relieve the stall and degrade the offending mRNA, a process known as No-Go mRNA Decay (NGD). While much of the machinery for NGD is known, the precise ordering of events and factors along this pathway has not been tested. Here, we deploy C. elegans to unravel the coordinated events comprising NGD. Utilizing a novel reporter and forward and reverse genetics, we identify the machinery required for NGD. Our subsequent molecular analyses define a functional requirement for ubiquitination on at least two ribosomal proteins (eS10 and uS10), and we show that ribosomes lacking ubiquitination sites on eS10 and uS10 fail to perform NGD in vivo. We show that the nuclease NONU-1 acts after the ubiquitin ligase ZNF-598, and discover a novel requirement for the ribosome rescue factors HBS-1/PELO-1 in mRNA decay via NONU-1. Taken together, our work demonstrates mechanisms by which ribosomes signal to effectors of mRNA repression, and we delineate links between repressive factors working toward a well-defined NGD pathway.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRibosomes are large molecular machines entrusted with the essential task of reading mRNAs and building proteins. It is critical that ribosomes proceed with their work undeterred, so as to avoid traffic jams between ribosomes on mRNAs; however, they sometimes experience challenges which make traffic jams unavoidable. In these cases, cells have evolved machinery to clean up stalled ribosomes and remove offending mRNAs. Much of this machinery is now identified, but the relationships between factors has yet to be tested. Here, in C. elegans we identify the machinery that responds to stalls, and we order factors relative to one another. We find that ribosomes must be tagged by ubiquitin to signal mRNA decay, as ribosomes lacking ubiquitin sites fail to elicit mRNA decay. Furthermore, we find that these ubiquitin signals recruit an enzyme which cuts mRNA, and we present evidence that ribosome rescue factors are required for the mRNA decay reaction as well. Overall, our work provides new connections between factors orchestrating the elimination of problematic mRNAs that stall ribosomes.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2021.11.08.467757"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.12.09.472002", "title": "Contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum sheets and mitochondria regulate mitochondrial DNA replication and segregation", "authors": "Ilamathi, H.

Specifically, mitochondrial fusion is essential for mtDNA maintenance. In contrast, while loss of mitochondrial fission causes the aggregation of nucleoids (mtDNA-protein complexes), its role in nucleoid distribution remains unclear. Here, we show that contact sites between mitochondria and ER sheets, the ER structure associated with protein synthesis, regulate mtDNA replication and nucleoid distribution within mitochondrial networks.

MinHash is one such technique to estimate set similarity that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes. FracMinHash was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. This approach has been successfully applied to metagenomic taxonomic profiling in the widely used tool sourmash gather. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis to derive various statistics of FracMinHash, and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased (in the sense that its expected value is not equal to the quantity it attempts to estimate), this bias is easily corrected for both the containment and Jaccard index versions. Next, we show how FracMinHash can be used to compute point estimates as well as confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distance between a pair of sequences by assuming a simple mutation model. We also investigate edge cases where these analyses may fail, to effectively warn the users of FracMinHash indicating the likelihood of such cases. Our analyses show that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the point estimates and confidence intervals perform significantly better in estimating mutation distances.

To circumvent this problem, we have implemented patch-clamp fluorometry in combination with the incorporation of the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid Anap to monitor channel opening and movement of the S4 segment. Simultaneous recording of currents and fluorescence signals allows for direct correlation of these parameters and investigation of their dependence on voltage and the pH gradient ({Delta}pH). We present data that indicate that Anap incorporated in the S4 helix is quenched by an aromatic residue located in the S2 helix, and that motion of the S4 relative to this quencher is responsible for fluorescence increases upon depolarization. The kinetics of the fluorescence signal reveals the existence of a very slow transition in the deactivation pathway, which seems to be singularly regulated by {Delta}pH.

Powerful applications have been proven, including clustering chemical and genetic perturbations based on their similar morphological impact, identifying disease phenotypes by observing differences in profiles between healthy and diseased cells, and predicting assay outcomes using machine learning, among many others. Here we provide an updated protocol for the most popular assay for image-based profiling, Cell Painting. Introduced in 2013, it uses six stains imaged in five channels and labels eight diverse components of the cell: DNA, cytoplasmic RNA, nucleoli, actin, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. The original protocol was updated in 2016 based on several years experience running it at two sites, after optimizing it by visual stain quality. Here we describe the work of the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium, aiming to improve upon the assay via quantitative optimization, based on the measured ability of the assay to detect morphological phenotypes and group similar perturbations together. We find that the assay gives very robust outputs despite a variety of changes to the protocol and that two vendors dyes work equivalently well. We present Cell Painting version 3, in which some steps are simplified and several stain concentrations can be reduced, saving costs.

Characterization of recorded transients is often hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Reduction of the noise by filtering has limited use due to partial signal distortion. Occasionally, transients can be approximated by a mathematical function, but such a function may not hold correctly if recording conditions change. We introduce here the model-independent approximation method for general noisy transient signals based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR). The method was implemented in the software TransientAnalyzer, which detects transients in a record, finds their best approximation by the Gaussian process, constructs a surrogate spline function, and estimates specified signal parameters. The method and software were tested on a cellular model of the calcium concentration transient corrupted by various SNR levels and recorded at a low sampling frequency. Statistical analysis of the model data sets provided the error of estimation <7.5% and the coefficient of variation of estimates <17% for peak SNR=5. The performance of GPR on signals of diverse experimental origin was even better than fitting by a function. The software and its description are available on GitHub.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTransient signals convey information on the state and function of the studied system. However, the estimation of their characteristic parameters is complicated by the noise present in the recordings.

Evidence from a handful of study cases suggests this transformation is due to gene regulatory changes that result in non-additive phenotypes. Employing data from published genetic crosses, we estimated the role of non-additive gene action in the modulation of transcriptional landscapes in three domesticated plants: maize, sunflower, and chili pepper. Using A. thaliana, we assessed the correlation between gene regulatory network (GRN) connectivity properties, transcript abundance variation, and gene action. Finally, we investigated the propagation of non-additive gene action in GRNs.\n\nResultsWe compared crosses between domesticated plants and their wild relatives to a set of control crosses that included a pair of subspecies evolving under natural selection and a set of inbred lines evolving under domestication. We found abundance differences on a higher portion of transcripts in crosses between domesticated-wild plants relative to the control crosses. These transcripts showed non-additive gene action more often in crosses of domesticated-wild plants than in our control crosses. This pattern was strong for genes associated with cell cycle and cell fate determination, which control organ size. We found weak but significant negative correlations between the number of targets of trans-acting genes (Out-degree) and both the magnitude of transcript abundance differences a well as the absolute degree of dominance. Likewise, we found that the number of regulators that control a genes expression (In-degree) is weakly but negatively correlated with the magnitude of transcript abundance differences. We observed that dominant-recessive gene action is highly propagable through GRNs. Finally, we found that transgressive gene action is driven by trans-acting regulators showing additive gene action.\n\nConclusionsOur study highlights the role of non-additive gene action on modulating domestication-related traits such as organ size via regulatory divergence. We propose that GRNs are shaped by regulatory changes at genes with modest connectivity, which reduces the effects of antagonistic pleiotropy. Finally, we provide empirical evidence of the propagation of non-additive gene action in GRNs, which suggests a transcriptional epistatic model for the control of polygenic traits such as organ size.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/30/2022.10.13.511672"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.10.23.512790", "title": "Multiomic single-cell lineage tracing to dissect fate-specific gene regulatory programs", "authors": "Jindal, K.; Adil, M.

Compliance is regulated by the stiffness of the aortic wall and the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within it. During ageing, the extracellular matrix of the aortic wall stiffens, reducing compliance and leading to conditions such as hypertension. In response, VSMCs generate enhanced contractile forces and undergo hypertrophy, promoting VSMC stiffening and further reducing compliance. Due to a lack of suitable in vitro models, the mechanisms driving VSMC hypertrophy in response to matrix stiffness remain poorly defined.\n\nExperimental ApproachHuman VSMCs were seeded onto polyacrylamide hydrogels whose stiffness mimicked either healthy or aged/diseased aortae. VSMC response to contractile agonist stimulation was measured through changes in cell area and volume. VSMCs were pre-treated with pharmacological agents prior to agonist stimulation to identify regulators of VSMC contractility and hypertrophy.\n\nKey ResultsVSMCs undergo a differential response to contractile agonist stimulation based on matrix stiffness. On pliable hydrogels, VSMCs contract, decreasing in cell area whereas on rigid hydrogels, VSMCs undergo a hypertrophic response, increasing in area and volume. Microtubule stabilisation prevented hypertrophy whilst leaving VSMC contraction on pliable hydrogels unimpeded. Conversely, microtubule destabilisation inhibited contraction and induced hypertrophy within VSMCs on pliable hydrogels.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsIn response to enhanced matrix rigidity, VSMC undergo a hypertrophic response as result of decreased microtubule stability. Using standard biological techniques and equipment, we present a screening assay capable of identifying novel regulators of matrix rigidity induced VSMC hypertrophy.

Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and Hi-C are powerful methods to study the 3D genome organization. However, ChIA-PET and Hi-C experiments are expensive, time-consuming, require tens to hundreds of millions of cells, and are challenging to optimize and analyze. Predicting ChIA-PET/Hi-C data using cheaper ChIP-Seq data and other easily obtainable features could be a useful alternative. It is well-established that the cohesin protein complex is a key determinant of 3D genome organization. Here we present Chromatin Interaction Predictor (ChIPr), a suite of regression models based on deep neural networks (DNN), random forest, and gradient boosting, respectively, to predict cohesin-mediated chromatin interaction strength between any two loci in the genome. Comprehensive tests on four cell lines show that the predictions of ChIPr correlate well with the original ChIA-PET data at the peak-level resolution and bin sizes of 25 and 5 Kbp. In addition, ChIPr can accurately capture most of the cell-type-dependent loops identified by ChIA-PET and Hi-C data. Rigorous feature testing indicated that genomic distance and RAD21 (a cohesin component) ChIP-Seq signals are the most important inputs for ChIPr in determining chromatin interaction strength. The standard ChIPr model requires three experimental inputs: ChIP-Seq signals for RAD21, H3K27ac (enhancer/active chromatin mark) and H3K27me3 (inactive chromatin mark). The minimal ChIPr model performs comparably and requires a single experimental input: ChIP-Seq signals for RAD21. Integrative analysis revealed novel insights into the role of CTCF motif, its orientation, and CTCF binding on the prevalence and strength of cohesin-mediated chromatin interactions.

The structural organization of vinculin allows it to bind on one part to specific amphipathic motifs collectively designated as vinculin binding sites (VBS), to a set of different vinculin coactivators or actin regulators, and finally a domain responsible to constantly bind to F-actin in a catch bond manner. However, the ability of vinculin to effectively bind all of those intracellular partners, is highly dependent on its structural organization. Which is critically dependent on its ability to respond to mechanical tension on the molecule itself and not necessarily to its binding capacity to VBSs and complementary activators. This is recognized as the combinatorial model of activation. Nonetheless, Shigellas IpaA effector protein is able to mimic the conformational changes associated with the ones associated with the mechanical deformation of the molecule. This model of vinculin activation is designated as the non-combinatorial model, as the presence of a single activation-partner is enough to get the same effect. This work is devoted to dig in further to develop the previous work from this lab, as we have been able to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects of Shigellas IpaA-Cterm region as the one responsible for both inducing conformational changes in solution, as well as the formation of super-stable adhesion, associated to maturity markers as VASP and alpha actinin. Additionally the IpaA-Cterm transfection renders those cells with the ability to maintain the adhesion structures stable and even resist the action of actomyosin relaxing molecules. Which renders them as mechanically-independent adhesions. We found that residue substitution at the surface of D1 and D2 interphase, (as well as residues maintaining the D2 domain helical bundles folded), might participate in the maintaining the structural integrity and interdomain interaction during force dependent as revealed by its ability to form protein complexes in vitro and under force-independent settings, as the morphology of cellular adhesions is altered in a way different from the previously reported targeting only the D1-D5 interaction.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.23.517744"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.24.517853", "title": "Ultra Low Power, Event-Driven Data Compression of Multi-Unit Activity", "authors": "Savolainen, O.; zhang, z.; Constandinou, T.", "author_corresponding": "Oscar Savolainen", "author_corresponding_institution": "Imperial College London", "date": "2022-11-26", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "Recent years have demonstrated the feasibility of using intracortical Brain-Machine Interfaces (iBMIs), by decoding thoughts, for communication and cursor control tasks. iBMIs are increasingly becoming wireless due to the risks of infection and mechanical failure associated with percutaneous connections. However, wireless communication increases the power consumption, and the total power dissipation is strictly limited due to safety heating limits of cortical tissue. Since wireless power is proportional to the communication bandwidth, the output Bit Rate (BR) must be minimised. Whilst most iBMIs utilise Multi-Unit activity (MUA), i.e. spike events, and this in itself significantly reduces the output BR (compared to raw data), it still limits the scalability (number of channels) that can be achieved. As such, additional compression for MUA signals is essential for fully-implantable, high-information-bandwidth systems. To meet this need, this work proposes various hardware-efficient, ultra-low power MUA compression schemes. They are investigated in terms of their BRs and hardware requirements as a function of various on-implant conditions such as MUA Binning Period (BP) and number of channels. It was found that for BPs [&le;]10 ms, the Delta Event-Driven method had the lowest total dynamic power and reduced the BR by almost an order of magnitude relative to classical methods (e.g. to approx. 151 bps/channel for a BP of 1 ms and 1000 channels on-implant.). However, at larger BPs the Windowing method performed best (e.g. approx. 29 bps/channel for a BP of 50 ms, independent of channel count). As such, this work can guide the choice of MUA data compression scheme for BMI applications, where the BR can be significantly reduced in hardware efficient ways. This enables the next generation of wireless iBMIs, with small implant sizes, high channel counts, low-power, and small hardware footprint.

The nerves response would be measured by recording muscle activity and movement of the right hind limb.\n\nApproachThe MagPen was custom-built such that it can be held over the sciatic nerve in a stable manner. Rat leg muscle twitches were captured on video and movements were extracted using image processing algorithms. EMG recordings were also used to measure muscle activity.\n\nMain resultsThe MagPen prototype when driven by alternating current, generates time-varying magnetic field which as per Faradays Law of Electromagnetic Induction, induces an electric field for neuromodulation. The orientation dependent spatial contour maps for the induced electric field from the MagPen prototype has been numerically simulated. Furthermore, in this in vivo work on MS, a dose-response relationship has been reported by experimentally studying how the varying amplitude (Range: 25 mVp-p through 6 Vp-p) and frequency (Range: 100 Hz through 5 kHz) of the MagPen stimuli alters the hind limb movement. The primary highlight of this dose-response relationship is that at a higher frequency of the MS stimuli, significantly smaller amplitudes can trigger hind limb muscle twitch. This frequency-dependent activation can be justified following directly from the Faradays Law as the magnitude of the induced electric field is directly proportional to frequency.\n\nSignificanceThis work reports that MS can successfully activate the sciatic nerve in a dose-dependent manner. The MagPen probe, unlike electrodes, does not have a direct electrochemical interface with tissues rendering it much safer than an electrode. Magnetic fields create more precise activation than electrodes because they induce smaller volumes of activation.

Using simulated data and two scRNA-seq data sets from different tissues, we show that our method improves accuracy over a simple consensus algorithm and the average of the underlying tools. We then compare our method to a non-parametric neighbor majority approach, showing comparable results. We also demonstrate that our GCN method allows for feature interpretation, pulling out important genes for cell type classification. We present our completed pipeline, written in Pytorch, as an end-to-end tool for automating and interpreting the classification of scRNA-seq data.\n\nAvailabilityOur code for conducting the experiments in this paper and using our model is available at https://github.com/lewinsohndp/scSHARP\n\nContactd_lewinsohn@coloradocollege.edu", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.23.517739"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.23.517753", "title": "Re-implementation of an algorithm to integrate transcriptome and ChIP-seq data", "authors": "Ahmed, M.; Kim, D.

While thousands of new genomes are available today, no accurate methods exist to reliably mine those for microRNAs, an important class of post-transcriptional regulators. Currently, their prediction and annotation depend on the availability of transcriptomics data sets and hands-on expert knowledge leading to the large discrepancy between novel genomes made available and the availability of high-quality microRNA complements. Using the more than 16,000 microRNA entries from the manually curated microRNA gene database MirGeneDB, we generated and trained covariance models for each conserved microRNA family. These models are available in MirMachine, our new pipeline for automated annotation of conserved microRNAs. We show that MirMachine can be used to accurately and precisely predict conserved microRNA complements from genome assemblies, correctly identifying the number of paralogues, and by establishing the novel microRNA score, the completeness of assemblies. Built and trained on representative metazoan microRNA complements, we used MirMachine on a wide range of animal species, including those with very large genomes or additional genome duplications and extinct species such as mammoths, where deep small RNA sequencing data will be hard to produce. With accurate predictions of conserved microRNAs, the MirMachine workflow closes a long-persisting gap in the microRNA field that will not only facilitate automated genome annotation pipelines and can serve as a solid foundation for manual curation efforts, but deeper studies on the evolution of genome regulation, even in extinct organisms.

In the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A and triple-negative breast cancer cell line BT-549, TGF-{beta}1 stimulation upregulated the SRC1A promoter, resulting in increased SRC mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analysis revealed that SMAD2 binds to three enhancer regions ~15 kb upstream and downstream of the SRC promoter, and one of them is capable of activating the SRC promoter in response to TGF-{beta}. In addition, JUN, which is a member of the activator protein (AP)-1 family, also localizes to the enhancer and regulates TGF-{beta}-induced SRC expression. Moreover, the total amount of active SRC increased, coinciding with the TGF-{beta}-induced SRC expression. In TGF-{beta}-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-{beta}-induced SRC upregulation plays a crucial role in EMT-associated cell migration by activating the SRC/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) circuit.

In vitro transduction with AAV.GT5 in human hepatocytes was more than 100 times higher than with AAV-Spark100, while in vivo transduction efficacy into the liver and the increase in coagulation factor IX (FIX) antigen following intravenous injection of these vectors were similar in PXB mice (chimeric mice with a humanized liver) and macaques. The discrepancy was due to the low recovery and short half-life of AAV.GT5 in blood, depending on the positive charge of the heparin-binding site in the original AAV3B. The intra-hepatic vascular administration of AAV.GT5, but not AAV-Spark100, enhanced vector transduction into the liver and reduced vector distribution to the kidney in pigs. In macaques, the intra-hepatic artery injection of AAV.GT5 yielded a comparable increase in FIX antigen with a one-third dosage of peripheral venous administration. Two of four macaques who received AAV.GT5 intravenously did not develop neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AAV.GT5, while AAV-Spark100 induced serotype-specific NAbs in all four macaques. The NAb produced after the administration was relatively specific to the serotype and less responsive to the other serotype. As a result, the administration of AAV.GT5 successfully boosted FIX expression in one animal previously given AAV-Spark100. Thus, AAV.GT5 has different biodistribution and immunogenic characteristics compared with AAV-Spark100, and the intra-hepatic vascular administration may lessen the vector dose and avoid vector distribution to other organs.\n\nKey PointsO_LIThe AAV.GT5 vector has a strong transduction efficacy in human hepatocytes but has a faster clearance after systemic administration.\nC_LIO_LIIntra-hepatic vascular administration of the AAV.GT5 vector is an effective liver transduction method for hemophilia gene therapy.\nC_LI", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.24.517886"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.21.517389", "title": "A multi-omics atlas of the human retina at single-cell resolution", "authors": "Liang, Q.; Cheng, X.; Wang, J.; Owen, L.; Shakoor, A.; Lillvis, J.

Therefore, genotyping errors can be easily detected by linkage map quality evaluations.\n\nResultsWe developed and used the Reads2Map workflow to build linkage maps with simulated and empirical GBS data of diploid outcrossing populations. The workflows run GATK and freebayes for SNP calling and updog, polyRAD, and SuperMASSA for genotype calling, and OneMap and GUSMap to build linkage maps. Using simulated data, we observed which genotype call software fails in identifying common errors in GBS sequencing data and proposed specific filters to better handle them. We tested whether it is possible to overcome errors in a linkage map using genotype probabilities from each software or global error rates to estimate genetic distances with an updated version of OneMap. We also evaluated the impact of segregation distortion, contaminant samples, and haplotype-based multiallelic markers in the final linkage maps.

We conclude that end-stage MP aggregates were in a kinetically trapped conformation, whose kinetic barrier was bypassed upon either seeding by SI-derived fibrils or shaking in SI. We further show that MP-derived aggregates that form in the presence of sorbitol, an osmolyte, displayed a {beta}-rich signature, indicating that the preferential exclusion effect of osmolytes helped overcome the kinetic barrier. Our findings help in unravelling the kinetic origin of different -synuclein aggregated polymorphs (strains) that encode diverse variants of synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that kinetic control shapes the polymorphic landscape of -synuclein aggregates, both through de novo generation of polymorphs, and by their interconversion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517910v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa37d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36f023org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf8f12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9f584_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.25.517910"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.24.517890", "title": "Lipid Driven Inter-leaflet Coupling of Plasma Membrane Order Regulates FcεRI Signaling in Mast Cells", "authors": "Yang, G.-S.; Wagenknecht-Wiesner, A.; Yin, B.; Suresh, P.; London, E.; Baird, B.; Bag, N.", "author_corresponding": "Nirmalya Bag", "author_corresponding_institution": "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "date": "2022-11-25", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Engagement of high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor Fc{varepsilon}RI with extracellular, multivalent antigen (Ag) stabilizes co-existing ordered and disordered phases in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This optimally controls biochemical interactions between signaling components required for transmembrane (TM) signaling in mast cells. The biophysical organization of the resting inner leaflet is poised to respond appropriately to this extracellular stimulation. The resting inner leaflet is generally less ordered than the outer leaflet, with a lipid composition that does not spontaneously phase separate in model membranes. We proposed that coupling between the two leaflets mediates separation into different phase-like domains in the inner leaflet. To test this hypothesis in live cells, we first established a straightforward approach to evaluate changes in membrane order due to inter-leaflet coupling by measuring inner leaflet diffusion of phase-specific lipid probes with Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) before and after methyl--cyclodextrin (mCD)-catalyzed exchange of outer leaflet lipids (LEX) with exogenous order- or disorder-promoting phospholipids. We examined the functional impact of LEX by monitoring two Ag-stimulated cellular responses, namely early-stage recruitment of Syk kinase to the inner leaflet and late-stage exocytosis of secretory granules (degranulation). Based on changes in probe diffusion, we observed global increase or decrease of inner leaflet order when outer leaflet is exchanged with order or disorder promoting lipids, respectively, in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, the degree of stimulated Syk recruitment and degranulation correlates with the inner leaflet order of the resting cells, which was varied using LEX. Overall, combined LEX and ImFCS platform provides strong evidence of lipid-based control of stimulated TM signaling in live mast cells. In addition, our functional results imply that resting-state lipid composition and ordering of the outer leaflet sets the ordering of the inner leaflet, likely via interleaflet coupling, and correspondingly modulates TM signaling initiated by antigen-activated IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECoupling between plasma membrane leaflets, which are biochemically and biophysically asymmetric, results in a steady-state membrane organization that is thought to play fundamental roles in cellular functions. Here, we present a straightforward assay built around mCD-catalyzed lipid exchange (LEX) and Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) to quantitatively characterize a novel, lipid-driven, interleaflet coupling mechanism and its functional impact in live mast cells. We showed that elevation of outer leaflet lipid order induces ordering throughout the inner leaflet in resting cells. This ordering enhances protein-based reactions during Ag-stimulated Fc{varepsilon}RI signaling and consequent cellular response.

To address this problem, we measured for 99 RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes with 11 nucleotide length in a 1 M NaCl buffer using UV absorbance thermal denaturation. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained by fitting absorbance versus temperature profiles using SciPy non-linear curve fit. A dataset of 228 duplexes were constructed combining with literature experimental thermodynamic parameters for fitting a full set of all 113 possible Watson-Crick and single internal mismatch involving nearest-neighbor parameters using singular value decomposition.

Pi homeostasis in eukaryotes employs SPXs domains, which are receptors for inositol pyrophosphates. We explored how polymerization and storage of Pi in acidocalcisome-like vacuoles supports S. cerevisiae metabolism and how these cells recognize Pi scarcity. Whereas Pi starvation affects numerous metabolic pathways, beginning Pi scarcity affects few metabolites. These include inositol pyrophosphates and ATP, a low-affinity substrate for inositol pyrophosphate-synthesizing kinases. Declining ATP and inositol pyrophosphates may thus be indicators of impending Pi limitation. Actual Pi starvation triggers accumulation of the purine synthesis intermediate 5- aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), which activates Pi-dependent transcription factors. Cells lacking polyphosphate show Pi starvation features already under Pi-replete conditions, suggesting that vacuolar polyphosphate supplies Pi for metabolism even when Pi is abundant. However, polyphosphate deficiency also generates unique metabolic changes that are not observed in starving wildtype cells. Polyphosphate in acidocalcisome-like vacuoles may hence be more than a global phosphate reserve and channel Pi to preferred cellular processes.\n\nAbstract importanceCells must strike a delicate balance between the high demand of inorganic phosphate (Pi) for synthesizing nucleic acids and phospholipids, and its detrimental bioenergetic effects by reducing the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis. The latter may stall metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms manage the import and export of phosphate, its conversion into osmotically inactive inorganic polyphosphates, and their storage in dedicated organelles, acidocalcisomes. Here, we provide novel insights into metabolic changes that cells may use to signal declining phosphate availability in the cytosol and differentiate it from actual phosphate starvation. We also analyze the role of acidocalcisome-like organelles in phosphate homeostasis. This uncovers an unexpected role of the polyphosphate pool in these organelles under phosphate-rich conditions, indicating that its metabolic roles go beyond that of a phosphate reserve for surviving starvation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.22.517608"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.25.517891", "title": "A non-invasive, fast on/off 'Odourgenetic' Method to Manipulate Physiology", "authors": "ke, c.; cao, g.; Su, S.; Wu, Y.; Xu, X.; Hao, X.; Lu, W.; Li, X.; Wang, L.; Tian, W.; Gao, Y.", "author_corresponding": "changbin ke", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institute of Anesthesiology & Pain (IAP), Department of Anesthesiology, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, Hubei, China", "date": "2022-11-25", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Manipulating molecular processes governing physiological functions has significant potential for clinical therapeutics and is an important approach to elucidate the cellular basis of physiological functions.

Performance was evaluated with respect to data-specific features like sparsity and sequencing platform, biological properties like gene length, and the ability to recapitulate true levels of variability based on simulation and known biological gene sets like ribosomal genes and stably expressed genes. scran had the strongest all-round performance, and this metric was then applied to investigate the changes in cell-to-cell variability that occur during ageing.

Moreover, proteomics revealed the depletion of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake pathway proteins in {Delta}plaF, which agrees with the decreased concentrations of extracellular pyoverdine and intracellular iron and is likely responsible for its prolonged lag growth phase, presumably due to reduced iron uptake. Conversely, the accumulation of proteins from alternative iron-uptake systems in {Delta}plaF suggests that PlaF may function as a switch between different iron-acquisition pathways. The observation that {Delta}plaF accumulates PL-acyl chain modifying and PL synthesis enzymes reveals novel insights into the role of PlaF for membrane PL homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism by which PlaF simultaneously affects multiple pathways remains to be elucidated, we suggest that PlaF-catalyses the degradation of PLs which then serve as a signal that is amplified by proteins of two-component, phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation systems to elicit the global adaptive response in P. aeruginosa.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/25/2022.11.25.517918"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.25.517938", "title": "All families of transposable elements were active in the recent wheat genome evolution and polyploidy had no impact on their activity", "authors": "Papon, N.; Lasserre-Zuber, P.; Rimbert, H.; De Oliveira, R.; Paux, E.; Choulet, F.", "author_corresponding": "Frederic Choulet", "author_corresponding_institution": "University Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, GDEC, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France", "date": "2022-11-25", "category": "genomics", "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop and its genome is one of the largest ever assembled at reference-quality level.

Wheat genetic diversity was mainly focused on genes and little is known about the extent of genomic variability affecting TEs, transposition rate, and the impact of polyploidy. Multiple chromosome-scale assemblies are now available for bread wheat and for its tetraploid and diploid wild relatives. In this study, we computed base pair-resolved, gene-anchored, whole genome alignments of A, B, and D lineages at different ploidy levels in order to estimate the variability that affects the TE space. We used assembled genomes of 13 T. aestivum cultivars (6x=AABBDD), T. durum (4x=AABB), T. dicoccoides (4x=AABB), T. urartu (2x=AA), and Aegilops tauschii (2x=DD).

While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat.

However, anthelmintic resistance (AR) is increasing, and little is known about the molecular and genetic causes of resistance for most drugs. The free-living roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a tractable model to understand AR, where studies have led to the identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse C. elegans strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains displayed significant variation in anthelmintic responses across drug classes. Dose-response trends within a drug class showed that the C. elegans strains elicited similar responses within the benzimidazoles but variable responses in the macrocyclic lactones and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. Next, we compared the effective concentration estimates to induce a 10% maximal response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve of each strain to the reference strain, N2, which enabled the identification of anthelmintics with population-wide differences to understand how genetics contribute to AR. Because genetically diverse strains displayed differential susceptibilities within and across anthelmintics, we show that C. elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides. Third, we quantified the heritability of responses to each anthelmintic and observed a significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. Heritable genetic variation can be explained by strain-specific anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. These results suggest drugs to prioritize in genome-wide association studies, which will enable the identification of AR genes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYParasitic nematodes infect most animal species and significantly impact human and animal health. Control of parasitic nematodes in host species relies on a limited collection of anthelmintic drugs. However, anthelmintic resistance is widespread, which threatens our ability to control parasitic nematode populations. Here, we used the non-parasitic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study anthelmintic resistance across 26 anthelmintics that span ten drug classes. We leveraged the genetic diversity of C. elegans to quantify anthelmintic responses across a range of doses, estimate dose-response curves, fit strain-specific model parameters, and calculate the contributions of genetics to these parameters. We found that genetic variation within a species plays a considerable role in anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. Our results emphasize how the incorporation of genetically diverse C. elegans strains is necessary to understand anthelmintic response variation found in natural populations. These results highlight drugs to prioritize in future mapping studies to identify genes involved in anthelmintic resistance.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518036v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59765forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a7e22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eecf5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6d24f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/26/2022.11.26.518036"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.25.518003", "title": "A primary microcephaly-associated sas-6 mutation perturbs centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans", "authors": "Bergwell, M.; Smith, A.; Smith, E.; Duran, R.; Haastrup, E.; Napier-Jameson, R.; Dierlam, C.; Seidel, R.; Potter, W.; Norris, A.; Iyer, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jyoti Iyer", "author_corresponding_institution": "The University of Tulsa", "date": "2022-11-26", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "A missense mutation within the human SASS6 gene has been linked with the incidence of primary microcephaly in a Pakistani family.

Our studies revealed that both centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis are perturbed by the sas-6(L69T) mutation. Specifically, C. elegans carrying the sas-6(L69T) mutation exhibit an increased failure of centrosome duplication in a sensitized genetic background. Further, worms carrying this mutation also display shortened phasmid cilia, an abnormal phasmid cilia morphology, defective phasmid dendrite morphology and chemotaxis defects. Our data show that the centrosome duplication defects caused by this mutation are only uncovered in a sensitized genetic background, indicating that these defects are mild. However, the ciliogenesis defects caused by this mutation are evident in an otherwise wild-type background, indicating that they are stronger defects. Based on our findings, we propose that the ciliogenesis defects induced by this mutation are likely a more important contributing factor to the development of primary microcephaly in humans carrying this mutation than centrosome duplication defects. Thus, our studies shed light on a novel mechanism by which the sas-6(L69T) mutation could lead to the incidence of primary microcephaly in humans.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/26/2022.11.25.518003"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.25.518018", "title": "A conditional histone H3.3 mutation in mice orthologous to a driver of paediatric diffuse instrinsic pontine glioma", "authors": "Mann, J.

PAX6 is the master regulator of eye development, and has a regulatory landscape containing multiple enhancers driving expression in the eye. Whether these enhancers perform additive, redundant, or distinct functions is unknown. Here we describe the precise cell types and regulatory activity of two PAX6 retinal enhancers, HS5 and NRE. Using a unique combination of live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing in dual enhancer-reporter zebrafish embryos, we find significant differences in the spatiotemporal activity of these enhancers, and show that HS5 and NRE are active in distinct cell types of the developing retina.

While centromeres are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant called CENP-A rather than a particular DNA sequence, they are typically embedded in repeat-dense and heterochromatic chromosomal genome regions. In many species, centromeres are associated with transposable elements but it is unclear if these elements are selfish and target centromeres for insertion or if they play a role in centromere specification and function. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to understand the evolution of centromere-associated transposable elements. G2/Jockey-3 is a non-LTR retroelement in the Jockey clade and the only sequence shared by all centromeres. We study the evolution of G2/Jockey-3 using short and long read population genomic data to infer insertion polymorphisms across the genome. We combine estimates of the age, frequency, and location of insertions to infer the evolutionary processes shaping G2/Jockey-3 and its association with the centromeres. We find that G2/Jockey-3 is an active retroelement that is targeted by the piRNA pathway. Our results suggest that G2-Jockey-3 is highly enriched in centromeres at least in part due to an insertion bias. We do not detect any signature of positive selection on any G2/Jockey-3 insertions that would suggest than individual insertions are favored by natural selection. Instead, we infer that most insertions are neutral or weakly deleterious both inside and outside of the centromeres. Therefore, G2/Jockey-3 evolution is consistent with it being a selfish genetic element that targets centromeres. We suspect targeting centromeres for insertion helps active retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 escape host defenses, as the unique centromeric chromatin may prevent targeting by the host silencing machinery. On the other hand, centromeric TEs insertions may be tolerated or even beneficial if they also contribute to the right transcriptional and chromatin environment. Thus, we suspect centromere-associated retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 reflect a balance between conflict and cooperation at the centromeres.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/26/2022.11.25.518008"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.26.517656", "title": "CRISPR correction of GBA mutation in hiPSCs restores normal function to Gaucher macrophages and increases their susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "authors": "Ramalingam, S.; Kumar, A.; Krug, S.; Mohan, H.; Rao, D.

We investigated and compared the genomic consequences of these two paths to reestablishment using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 100 Svalbard reindeer across their range. We found little admixture between reintroduced and natural populations. Two reintroduced populations, each founded by 12 individuals around four decades (i.e. 8 reindeer generations) ago, formed two distinct genetic clusters. Compared to the source population, these populations showed only small decreases in genome-wide heterozygosity and increases in inbreeding and lengths of runs of homozygosity. In contrast, the two naturally recolonised populations without admixture possessed much lower heterozygosity, higher inbreeding, and longer runs of homozygosity, possibly caused by serial population bottlenecks and/or fewer or more genetically related founders than in the reintroduction events. Naturally recolonised populations can thus be more vulnerable to the accumulation of genetic load than reintroduced populations. This suggests that in some organisms even small-scale reintroduction programs based on genetically diverse source populations can be more effective than natural recolonisation in establishing genetically diverse populations.

Multiple partially structured states or intermediates co-exist in equilibrium in the native ensemble, with the TM helices 1, 6 and 7 displaying varied degrees of structure, and TM3 exhibiting the maximal stability. Active state GPCRs are characterized by reduced conformational heterogeneity with altered coupling-patterns distributed not just locally but throughout the structural scaffold.

Recently, the demand for sesame seeds and their products has increased worldwide, making it necessary to enhance the development of high-yielding cultivars. One approach to enhance genetic gain in breeding programs is genomic selection. However, studies on genomic selection and genomic prediction in sesame are limited. In this study, we performed genomic prediction for agronomic traits using the phenotypes and genotypes of a sesame diversity panel grown under Mediterranean climatic conditions over two growing seasons. We aimed to assess the accuracy of prediction for nine important agronomic traits in sesame using single- and multi-environment analyses. In single-environment analysis, genomic best linear unbiased prediction, BayesB, BayesC, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces models showed no substantial differences. The average prediction accuracy of the nine traits across these models ranged from 0.39-0.79 for both growing seasons. In the multi-environment analysis, the marker-by-environment interaction model, which decomposed the marker effects into components shared across environments and environment-specific deviations, improved the prediction accuracies for all traits by 15%-58% compared to the single-environment model, particularly when borrowing information from other environments was made possible. Our results showed that single-environment analysis produced moderate-to-high genomic prediction accuracy for agronomic traits in sesame. The multi-environment analysis further enhanced this accuracy by exploiting marker-by-environment interaction.

Extensive studies have been done on BRD4 as a target for several cancers, such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Burkitt Lymphoma. Several potential inhibitors have been identified against the BRD4 bromodomain. However, most of these inhibitors have drawbacks such as nonspecificity and toxicity, decreasing their appeal and necessitating the search for novel non-toxic inhibitors. This study aims to address this need by virtually screening natural compounds from the NPASS database against the Kac binding site of BRD4-BD1 using high throughput molecular docking followed by similarity clustering, pharmacokinetic screening, MD simulation, and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations. Using this approach, we identified five natural product inhibitors having a similar or better binding affinity to the BRD4 bromodomain compared to JQ1 (previously reported inhibitor of BRD4).

Antibodies are widely used to specifically bind cells and molecules to a solid support such as a column or suspended bead to separate, wash, and concentrate them. However, nonspecific binding of non-target cells and molecules to the support limits the specificity and resulting purity of traditional separation methods. Herein we describe a buoyant-antigen-magnetic (BAM) separation approach to increase specificity using two distinct separation processes with \"AND\" logic. Buoyant silica microbubbles and magnetic microbeads, each with their own antibody, bind to the target cell forming a BAM sandwich complex which can be separated from non-targeted cells (which are neither magnetic nor buoyant), as well as from cells bound to only single buoyant or magnetic microparticles but not both. Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogenic bacteria that can contaminate food products, was used as a model organism to establish a nearly 100-fold reduction in the non-specific carryover of non-target Escherichia coli bacteria in comparison to simple magnetic separation. Beads with no attached analyte were also removed. Furthermore, the BAM complexes could be visualized by eye (or camera) providing a rapid and sensitive method for pathogenic bacterial detection. Bacterial concentrations as low as 5 x 104 CFU/ml were evident by eye and could easily be distinguished from non-target S. aureus bacteria even at much higher concentrations (5x107 cfu/mL).

To identify critical lysosomal choline transport pathways, we engineered metabolic dependency on lysosome-derived choline in pancreatic cancer cells. We then exploited this dependency to perform an endolysosome-focused CRISPR-Cas9 negative selection screen for genes mediating lysosomal choline recycling.

As their biosynthesis depends on ATP concentration, PP-InsPs are tightly connected to cellular energy homeostasis. Consequently, an increasing number of studies involves PP-InsPs in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, aspects of tumorigenesis, and hyperphosphatemia. Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signalling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS. Using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that PP-InsP levels decrease upon exposure to oxidative stressors in HCT116 cells. Application of quinone drugs, particularly {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that {beta}-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are oxygen dependent. Experiments in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells deficient of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) demonstrated that {beta}-lap requires NQO1-bioactivation to regulate the cellular metabolism of PP-InsPs. Critically, significant reductions in cellular ATP concentrations were not directly mirrored in reduced PP-InsP levels as shown in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells treated with {beta}-lap. The data presented here unveil new aspects of {beta}-lap pharmacology and its impact on PP-InsP levels. Our identification of different quinone drugs as modulators of PP-InsP synthesis will allow to better appreciate their overall impact on cellular function.\n\n2 Significance StatementInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are messenger molecules regulating various functions in mammals. They are associated with the oxidative stress response, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigate PP-InsP signalling in mammalian cells subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Applying the quinone {beta}-lapachone ({beta}-lap) generated intracellular ROS resulting in decreased PP-InsP levels. This indicates a key role of PP-InsPs in cellular signalling under oxidative stress. Moreover, {beta}-lap mediated PP-InsP signalling required oxygen and the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). Since quinone drugs are cytotoxic, our data provide a basis for further investigations into the role of PP-InsPs during quinone-dependent chemotherapies. This is of special relevance since a phase II clinical trial demonstrated {beta}-lap efficacy in a combination chemotherapy against pancreatic cancer.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.27.518098"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.27.518129", "title": "Conformational changes in the essential E. coli septal cell wall synthesis complex suggest an activation mechanism", "authors": "Britton, B.

Our theoretical approach uses a mean-field theory that accounts for sequence-dependent electrostatic interactions via a random-phase approximation (RPA) and in addition allows for variable salt concentration for the condensed and dilute protein phases. The numerical solution of the complete phase diagrams together with the tie lines that we derive for this model system leaves two parameters to be determined by fitting experimental data on concentrations of all species involved in the system. For our comparisons, we focus on two proteins, PGL-3 and FUS, known to undergo LLPS. For PGL-3 we predict that its long IDR near the C-terminus promotes LLPS, which we validate through direct comparison with in vitro experimental results under the same physiological conditions. For the structurally more complex protein FUS the role of the low complexity (LC) domain in LLPS has been intensively studied. Apart from the LC domain we here investigate theoretically two IDRs, one near the N-terminus and another near the C-terminus. Our theoretical analysis of these domains predict that the IDR at the N-terminus (aa 1-285) is the main driver of LLPS of FUS by comparison to in vitro experiments of the full length protein under the same physiological temperature and salt conditions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIntrinsically disordered proteins are drivers of cellular liquid-liquid phase separation. However, it remains a challenge to directly predict the phase behaviour of a protein based on its primary sequence, and under physiological conditions. We present a random-phase approximation that allows for variable salt concentration and thus accounts for salt partitioning. We use this to link the sequence of the disordered regions with the behaviour of the complete protein through direct comparisons to in vitro phase-separation assays.

It was previously reported that knockout of Ku80 in a human cell line results in lethality, but the underlying cause of Ku essentiality in human cells has yet to be fully explored. Here, we established conditional Ku70 knockout cells to study the essentiality of Ku70 function. Endogenous Ku70 knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in cells where Ku70 expression was maintained through integration of an HA-tagged Ku70 cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Ku70 conditional knockout cell lines were identified via western blotting, and edits were validated by Sanger sequencing. We visually observed cell death in Ku70 knockout cells 8-10 days post Ku70-HA depletion, and loss of viability following Ku depletion was quantified using crystal violet assays. Interestingly, assessment of telomere length in Ku70 knockout cells using telomere restriction fragment analyses did not reveal any changes in average telomere length following Ku70-HA depletion. Immunofluorescence analysis used to assess {gamma}H2AX foci accumulation as a measure of double-stranded DNA breaks following Ku70-HA depletion allowed us to conclude that increased DNA damage is not the driving cause of loss of cell viability. Finally, quantitative proteome analysis of Ku70 knockout cells following Ku70-HA depletion identified a number of pathways and proteins that are significantly dysregulated following the loss of Ku70, including processes which Ku function has been previously associated with such as cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis.

Ku has also been involved in other cellular functions like telomere regulation and maintenance, in which Kus role is not fully characterized. Previous data suggest that while loss of Ku70/80 can be tolerated in other species, Ku is essential to humans. We have established a conditional Ku70 knockout in HEK293 cells to evaluate the basis of Ku essentiality in human cells. While we observed loss of cell viability upon Ku depletion, we did not observe significant changes in telomere length nor did we record lethal levels of DNA damage upon loss of Ku, suggesting that the reasons for the loss of viability is not linked to the functions of Ku in DNA repair or at telomeres. Analysis of global proteome changes following Ku70 depletion revealed dysregulations of several cellular pathways including cell cycle/mitosis, RNA related processes, and translation/ribosome biogenesis.

For this purpose, we processed short/long reads of 1550 bacterial isolates of the genera Anaplasma (n=20), Bartonella (n=131), Borrelia (n=311), Coxiella (n=73), Ehrlichia (n=13), Francisella (n=959) and Rickettsia (n=43) generated by second/third generation sequencing that have been freely accessible at the NCBI SRA repository. From Francisella tularensis, 98.9% of the samples contained the FTU-1 gene, and 16.3% contained additional ARGs. Only 2.2% of isolates from other genera (Bartonella: 2, Coxiella: 8, Ehrlichia: 1, Rickettsia: 2) contained any ARG. We found that the odds of ARG occurrence in Coxiella samples were significantly higher in isolates related to farm animals than from other sources. Our results describe a lack in ARGs in these bacteria and suggest that antibiotic susceptibility testing might be considered before the treatment of tick-borne infections in farm animals.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.28.518145"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.27.518126", "title": "Evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements in Magnaporthe oryzae reveal evidence of genomic transfer and key differences between rice and wheat blast pathotypes", "authors": "Nakamoto, A.

This threat is aggravated by their rapidly evolving genomes that adapt to evade host plant defenses, reducing the efficacy of deployed resistant crops.

Transposable elements (TEs) are hypothesized to be involved in the evolution and rapid adaptation of M. oryzae. However, there is still much to understand about how these elements behave in different M. oryzae host-specific lineages. In this study, we completed the annotation and phylogenetic classification of TEs in five lineages of M. oryzae. We identified differences in TE content between these lineages, and showed that recent lineage-specific expansions of certain TEs have contributed to greater TE content in rice-infecting and Setaria-infecting lineages. We reconstructed the histories of LTR-retrotransposon expansions and found them to have experienced complex dynamics, where some were caused by the proliferation of one element, while others consisted of multiple elements from an older population of TEs that proliferated in parallel. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting the recent transfer of a DNA transposon between rice and wheat M. oryzae lineages, and a region showing evidence of recombination between those lineages, which could have facilitated such a transfer. These results point towards key differences in TE dynamics, evolutionary history, and adaptive potential between the rice-and-Setaria-infecting and the wheat-Lolium-and-Eleusine-infecting lineage groups.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.27.518126"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.518169", "title": "CommonNNClustering--A Python package for generic common-nearest-neighbour clustering", "authors": "Kapp-Joswig, J.-O.; Keller, B.

However, recently proposed protein language models provide enriched sequence representations that may contain higher-level pattern information on which more performant phosphorylation site predictions may be based.\n\nResultsWe explored the applicability of protein language models to general phosphorylation site prediction. We found that training prediction models on top of protein language models yield a relative improvement of between 13.4% and 63.3% in terms of area under the precision-recall curve over the state-of-the-art predictors. Advanced model interpretation and model transferability experiments reveal that across models, protease-specific cleavage patterns give rise to a protease-specific training bias that results in an overly optimistic estimation of phosphorylation site prediction performance, an important caveat in the application of advanced machine learning approaches to protein modification prediction based on proteomics data.\n\nAvailability and implementationPhosphoLingo code, datasets, and predictions are available at https://github.com/jasperzuallaert/PhosphoLingo.\n\nContactjasper.zuallaert@vib-ugent.be, sven_degroeve@vib-ugent.be\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary materials are available at bioRxiv", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.28.518163"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.518195", "title": "Highly potent antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome", "authors": "Dauksaite, V.; Tas, A.; Wachowius, F.; Spruit, A.; van Hemert, M.; Snijder, E.; van der Veer, E.

In contrast to most other lanthipeptide synthetases, ProcM, a class II lanthipeptide synthetase, demonstrates high substrate tolerance. It is enigmatic that a single enzyme can catalyze the cyclization process of a diverse range of substrates with high fidelity. Previous studies suggested that the site-selectivity of lanthionine formation is determined by substrate sequence rather than by the enzyme. However, exactly how substrate sequence contributes to site-selective lanthipeptide biosynthesis is not clear. In this study, we performed molecular dynamic simulations for ProcA3.3 core peptide variants to explore how the predicted solution structure of the substrate without enzyme correlates to final product formation. Our simulation results support a model in which the secondary structure of the core peptide controls the ring pattern of the final product. We also demonstrate that the dehydration step in the biosynthesis pathway does not influence the site-selectivity of ring formation. In addition, we performed simulation for the core peptides of ProcA1.1 and 2.8, which are well-suited candidates to investigate the connection between order of ring formation and solution structure. Simulation results indicate that in both cases, C-terminal ring formation is more likely which was supported by experimental results. Our findings indicate that the substrate sequence and its solution structure can be used to predict the site-selectivity and order of ring formation, and that secondary structure is a crucial factor influencing the site-selectivity. Taken together, these findings will facilitate our understanding of the lanthipeptide biosynthetic mechanism and accelerate bioengineering efforts for lanthipeptide-derived products.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.28.518241"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.518223", "title": "The simulation of functional heterogeneity in procedurally generated fibrotic atrial tissue", "authors": "Kalinin, A.; Kovalenko, S.; Berezhnoy, A.

The combination of these effects creates dynamic heterogeneity of the conducting tissue and affects the migration and pinning of spiral waves, which makes the model a potential tool for prognostic modeling of AP and search for ablation targets.

Exercise training prevented an increase in body fat mass and fasting plasma glucose as expected, but neither early nor late training affected liver triglyceride or cholesterol content compared to sedentary mice, likely due to a very early stage of hepatic steatosis. In line, hepatic expression of de novo lipogenesis genes (e.g., Fasn, Srebp1c) was similarly downregulated by early and late training. However, exercise had a distinct time-dependent effect on hepatic inflammation, as only early training promoted an influx of pro-inflammtory cells into the liver paired with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. Tnfa, Il1b).

Metabolomic analyses revealed that increased intracellular glucose accompanies differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. This elevation also occurred in differentiating cells from other tissues and was verified in epidermal tissue engineered with glucose sensors, which detected a glucose gradient that peaked in the outermost differentiated layers. Free glucose accumulation, unaccompanied by its increased metabolism, was essential for epidermal differentiation and required GLUT1, GLUT3, and SGLT1 transporters. Glucose affinity chromatography and azido-glucose click chemistry uncovered glucose binding to diverse regulatory proteins, including the IRF6 TF, whose epidermal knockout confirmed its requirement in glucose-dependent differentiation. Direct glucose binding enabled IRF6 dimerization, DNA binding, genomic localization, and induction of IRF6 target genes, including essential pro-differentiation TFs GRHL1, GRHL3, HOPX and PRDM1. The IRF6R84C mutant found in undifferentiated cancers was unable to bind glucose. These data identify a new role for glucose as a gradient morphogen that modulates protein multimerization in cellular differentiation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.28.518222"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.518229", "title": "Cis-regulatory effect of HPV integration is constrained by host chromatin architecture in cervical cancers", "authors": "Singh, A.

Although the oncogenic impact of HPV encoded genes (such as E6/E7) is well known, the cis-regulatory effect of integrated HPV DNA on host chromatin structure and gene regulation remains less understood. Here, we investigate the genome-wide patterns of HPV integrations and associated host gene expression changes in the context of chromatin states and topologically associating domains (TADs). We find that HPV integrations are significantly enriched and depleted in active and inactive chromatin regions, respectively. Interestingly, regardless of the chromatin state, the genomic regions flanking HPV integrations showed transcriptional upregulation. Nevertheless, the upregulation (both local and long-range) is mostly confined to the TADs with integration and does not affect the adjacent TADs. Few TADs showed recurrent integrations associated with overexpression of oncogenes within them (such as MYC, PVT1, TP63 and ERBB2), regardless of the proximity. To further understand the long-range effect, we performed HiC and 4C-seq analyses in HeLa and observed chromatin looping interaction between the integrated HPV and MYC/PVT1 regions (situated [~]500 kb apart), leading to allele-specific overexpression of these genes. Again, these chromatin interactions involving integrated HPV are mostly observed within the same TAD. Together, these results suggest the cis-regulatory potential of integrated HPV DNA that drives host gene upregulation at intra-TAD level in cervical cancer. Based on this, we propose HPV integrations can trigger multimodal oncogenic activation to promote cancer progression.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/28/2022.11.28.518229"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.518196", "title": "ViCloD, an interactive web tool for visualizing B cell repertoires and analyzing intra-clonal diversities: application to human B-cell tumors", "authors": "Jeusset, L.; Abdollahi, N.; De Septenville, A.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly dysregulated in patients with AVS undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, miRNA-dependent mechanisms regulating inflammation and calcification or miRNA-mediated cell-cell crossstalk during the pathogenesis of AVS are still poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of extracellular vesicles (EV)-associated miR-145-5p, which we showed to be highly upregulated upon valvular calcification in AVS in mice and humans.\n\nMethodsHuman TaqMan miRNA arrays identified dysregulated miRNAs in aortic valve tissue explants from AVS patients compared to non-calcified valvular tissue explants of patients undergoing SAVR. Echocardiographic parameters were measured in association with the quantification of dysregulated miRNAs in a murine AVS model. In vitro calcification experiments were performed to explore the effects of EV-miR-145-5p on calcification and crosstalk in valvular cells. To dissect molecular miRNA signatures and their effect on signaling pathways, integrated OMICS analyses were performed. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), high-throughput transcription factor (TF) and proteome arrays showed that a number of genes, miRNAs, TFs, and proteins are crucial for calcification and apoptosis, which are involved in the pathogenesis of AVS.\n\nResultsAmong several miRNAs dysregulated in valve explants of AVS patients, miR-145-5p was the most highly gender-independently dysregulated miRNA (AUC, 0.780, p-value, 0.01). MiRNA arrays utilizing patient-derived- and murine aortic-stenosis samples demonstrated that the expression of miR-145-5p is significantly upregulated and correlates positively with cardiac function based on echocardiography. In vitro experiments confirmed that miR-145-5p is encapsulated into EVs and shuttled into valvular interstitial cells. Based on the integrated OMICs results, miR-145-5p interrelates with markers of inflammation, calcification, and apoptosis. In vitro calcification experiments demonstrated that miR-145-5p regulates the ALPL gene, a hallmark of calcification in vascular and valvular cells. EV-mediated shuttling of miR-145-5p suppressed the expression of ZEB2, a negative regulator of the ALPL gene, by binding to its 3 untranslated region to inhibit its translation, thereby diminishing the calcification of target valvular interstitial cells.\n\nConclusionElevated levels of pro-calcific and pro-apoptotic EV-associated miR-145-5p contribute to the progression of AVS via the ZEB2-ALPL axis, which could potentially be therapeutically targeted to minimize the burden of AVS.\n\nClinical SignificanceO_ST_ABSWhat is known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most prevalent structural heart valve disease requiring surgical or interventional valve replacement.

Measurement of head spinning has not been straightforward due to its symmetric head morphology, its translucent nature and fast 3D motion driven by its helical flagellum movement. Microscope image acquisition has been mostly restricted to 2D single focal plane images limited to head position tracing, in absence of head orientation and rotation in 3D. To date, human sperm spinning has been reported to be mono or bidirectional, and even intermittently changing direction. This variety in head spinning direction, however, appears to contradict observations of conserved helical beating of the human sperm flagellum. Here, we reconcile these observations by directly measuring the head spinning movement of freely swimming human sperm with multi-plane 4D microscopy. We show that 2D microscopy is unable to distinguish the spinning direction in human sperm. We evaluated the head spinning of 409 spermatozoa in four different conditions: in non-capacitating and capacitating solutions, for both aqueous and viscous media. All spinning spermatozoa, regardless of the experimental conditions spun counterclockwise (CCW) as seen from head-to-tail. Head spinning was suppressed in 57% of spermatozoa swimming in non-capacitating viscous media, though, interestingly, they recovered the CCW spinning after incubation in capacitating conditions within the same viscous medium. Our observations show that the spinning direction in human sperm is conserved, even when recovered from non-spin, indicating the presence of a robust and persistent helical driving mechanism powering the human sperm flagellum, thus of critical importance in future sperm motility assessments, human reproduction research and microorganism self-organised swimming.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.28.517870"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.517312", "title": "Utilization of an Artery-on-a-chip to unravel novel regulators and therapeutic targets in vascular diseases", "authors": "Paloschi, V.; Pauli, J.; Winski, G.; Wu, Z.; Li, Z.; Glukha, N.; Hummel, N.; Rogowitz, R.; Meucci, S.; Botti, L.; Busch, A.; Chernogubova, E.; Jin, H.; Sachs, N.; Eckstein, H.-H.; Boon, R.

We obtained biopsies from patients affected by carotid artery disease (CAD), comprising the atherosclerotic plaque (diseased artery) and the adjacent region (non-diseased artery). From patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), we obtained the aneurysmal portion (diseased aorta) and non-dilated adjacent segment (non-diseased aorta). Genes modulated by shear stress followed the same expression pattern in non-diseased segments of human vessels and were expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence analysis and single cell RNA sequencing.

However, it has been widely observed that the association estimates of variants tend to be lower in a replication study than in the study that discovered those associations. A phenomenon known as Winners Curse is responsible for this upward bias present in association estimates of significant variants in the discovery study. We review existing Winners Curse correction methods which require only GWAS summary statistics in order to make adjustments. In addition, we propose modifications to improve existing methods and propose a novel approach which uses the parametric bootstrap. We evaluate and compare methods, first using a wide variety of simulated data sets and then, using real data sets for three different traits. The metric, estimated mean squared error (MSE) over significant SNPs, was primarily used for method assessment. Our results indicate that widely used conditional likelihood based methods tend to perform poorly. The other considered methods behave much more similarly, with our proposed bootstrap method demonstrating very competitive performance. To complement this review, we have developed an R package,  winnerscurse which can be used to implement these various Winners Curse adjustment methods to GWAS summary statistics.\n\nAuthor SummaryA genome-wide association study is designed to analyse many common genetic variants in thousands of samples and identify which variants are associated with a trait of interest. It provides estimates of association strength for each variant and variants are classified as associated if their test statistics obtained in the study pass a chosen significance threshold. However, due to a phenomenon known as Winners Curse, the association estimates of these significant variants tend to be upward biased and greater in magnitude than their true values. Naturally, this bias has adverse consequences for downstream statistical techniques which use these estimates. In this paper, we look at current methods which have been designed to combat Winners Curse and propose modifications to these methods in order to improve performance.

Constructing such comprehensive references requires large-scale integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata capturing demographic and technical information. Here, we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), a semi-supervised conditional deep generative model for data integration, label transfer and query-to-reference mapping. Unlike other models, scPoli learns both sample and cell representations, is aware of cell-type annotations and can integrate and annotate newly generated query datasets while providing an uncertainty mechanism to identify unknown populations. We extensively evaluated the method and showed its advantages over existing approaches. We applied scPoli to two population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the latter consisting of roughly 8 million cells across 2,375 samples. We demonstrate that scPoli allows atlas-level integration and automatic reference mapping with label transfer. It can explain sample-level biological and technical variations such as disease, anatomical location and assay by means of its novel sample embeddings. We use these embeddings to explore sample-level metadata, enable automatic sample classification and guide a data integration workflow. scPoli also enables simultaneous sample-level and cell-level analysis of gene expression patterns, revealing genes associated with batch effects and the main axes of between-sample variation. We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.28.517803"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518294", "title": "Kinetic and thermodynamic allostery in the Ras protein family", "authors": "Manley, L.

However, allosteric mechanisms are usually not explained by protein structure, requiring information on correlated fluctuations uniquely accessible to molecular simulation. Existing work to extract allosteric pathways from molecular dynamics simulations has focused on thermodynamic correlations. Here we show how kinetic correlations (i.e. dynamical activity) encode complementary information essential to explain observed variations in allosteric regulation. We performed atomistic simulations, totalling 0.5 milliseconds, on H, K, and NRas isoforms in the apo, GTP, and GDP-bound states of Ras protein, with and without complexing to its downstream effector, Raf. We show that differences in experimentally measured intrinsic and Raf-dependent catalytic speed amongst the three isoforms can be explained by dynamical activity and entropy, respectively. We show that Switch I and Switch II are the primary components of thermodynamic and kinetic allosteric networks, consistent with the key roles of these two motifs. These communication networks are altered by the hydrolysis of the substrate gamma phosphate, leading to increased entropy in HRas loops involved in substrate release. We find that the putative allosteric region is not coupled in KRas, but is coupled to the hydrolysis arm switch II in NRas and HRas, and that the mechanism in the latter two isoforms are thermodynamic and kinetic, respectively. Binding of Raf-RBD further activates thermodynamic allostery in HRas and KRas but has limited effect on NRas. These results indicate that kinetic and thermodynamic correlations are both needed to explain protein function and allostery. These two distinct channels of allosteric regulation, and their combinatorial variability, may explain how subtle mutational differences can lead to diverse regulatory profiles among enzymatic proteins.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.29.518294"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.28.517589", "title": "Eosinophilic esophagitis-associated epithelial remodeling may limit esophageal carcinogenesis", "authors": "Fuller, A.

This proliferation/differentiation gradient is perturbed in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Esophageal cancer is among the deadliest forms of human malignancy with 5-year survival rates of <20%. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are the two most common subtypes of esophageal cancer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a primary risk factor for EAC. Although GERD and the food allergy-mediated condition eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are both associated with chronic esophageal inflammation and epithelial remodeling, including basal cell hyperplasia, epidemiological evidence suggests that EoE patients do not develop esophageal malignancy. Here, we perform single cell RNA-sequencing in murine models of EoE and ESCC to delineate the effects that these two conditions have specifically upon the cellular landscape of esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE or ESCC, we find expansion of cell populations as compared to normal esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE, we detect expansion of 4 suprabasal populations coupled with depletion of 4 basal cell populations. By contrast, mice with ESCC display expansion of 4 basal populations as well as depletion of 3 superficial populations. We further evaluated modules of co-expressed genes in EoE- and ESCC-enriched epithelial cell clusters. Senescence, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor pathways were associated with EoE-enriched clusters while pathways associated with cell proliferation and metabolism were identified in ESCC-enriched clusters. Finally, by pairing murine models of EoE and ESCC, we demonstrate that exposure to EoE inflammation limits esophageal carcinogenesis. Our findings provide the first functional investigation of the relationship between EoE and esophageal cancer and suggest that esophageal epithelial remodeling events occurring in response to EoE inflammation may limit act to esophageal carcinogenesis which may have future implications for leveraging allergic inflammation-associated alterations in epithelial biology to prevent and/or treat esophageal cancer.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.28.517589"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.23.517757", "title": "The algorithm for proven and young (APY) from a different perspective", "authors": "Nilforooshan, M.

Dividing individuals into core and non-core, G-1 is approximated via the inverse partition of G for core individuals. The quality of the approximation depends on the core size and composition.

Our Fusion scheme establishes functional relationships between bacteria and thus assigns organisms to Fusion taxa that differ from otherwise defined taxonomic clades. Three key findings of our work stand out. First, Fusion profile comparisons outperform existing functional annotation schemes in recovering taxonomic labels. Second, Fusion-derived functional co-occurrence profiles reflect known metabolic pathways, suggesting a route for discovery of new ones.

As a permanent and passive solution to the foreign body response, this work investigates ultra-low-fouling poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA) thin film hydrogels that are simultaneously photo-grafted and photo-polymerized onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The cellular anti-fouling properties of these coatings are robustly maintained even after six-months subcutaneous incubation and over a broad range of cross-linker compositions. On pCBMA-coated PDMS sheets implanted subcutaneously, capsule thickness and inflammation are reduced significantly in comparison to uncoated PDMS or coatings of polymerized poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (pPEGDMA) or poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA). Further, capsule thickness is reduced over a wide range of pCBMA cross-linker compositions. On cochlear implant electrode arrays implanted subcutaneously for one year, the coating bridges over the exposed platinum electrodes and dramatically reduces the capsule thickness over the entire implant. Coated cochlear implant electrode arrays could therefore lead to persistent improved performance and reduced risk of residual hearing loss.

For this reason, in the last few years, the immunoinformatic community has developed several computational predictive tools.\n\nWhile relatively successful, most of these tools only use a few properties of the candidate region to determine their likelihood of being a true B-cell epitope. However, this likelihood is influenced by a wide variety of protein features, including the presence of glycosylated residues in the neighbourhood of the candidate epitope, the subcellular location of the protein region or the three-dimensional information about their surface accessibility in the parental protein.\n\nIn this study we created Brewpitopes, an integrative pipeline to curate computational predictions of B-cell epitopes by accounting for all the aforementioned features. To this end, we implemented a set of rational filters to mimic the conditions for the in vivo antibody recognition to enrich the B-cell epitope predictions in actionable candidates. To validate Brewpitopes, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. In the S protein, Brewpitopes enriched the initial predictions in 5-fold on epitopes with neutralizing potential (p-value < 2e-4). Other than S protein, 4 out of 16 proteins in the proteome contain curated B-cell epitopes and hence, have also potential interest for viral neutralization, since mutational escape mainly affects the S protein. Our results demonstrate that Brewpitopes is a powerful pipeline for the rapid prediction of refined B-cell epitopes during public health emergencies.\n\nStatement of significanceWe have created Brewpitopes, a new pipeline that integrates additional important features such as glycosylation or structural accessibility, to curate B-cell epitope more likely to be functional in vivo. We have also validated Brewpitopes against SARS-CoV-2 not only for S protein but also for the entire viral proteome demonstrating that is a rapid and reliable epitope predictive tool to be implemented in present or future public health emergencies.

POEs can arise from different phenomena including genomic imprinting and have been documented for many complex traits. Traditional tests for POEs require family data to determine parental origins of transmitted alleles. As most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) instead sample unrelated individuals (where allelic parental origin is unknown), the study of POEs in such datasets requires sophisticated statistical methods that exploit genetic patterns we anticipate observing when POEs exist. We propose a method to improve discovery of POE variants in large-scale GWAS samples that leverages potential pleiotropy among multiple correlated traits often collected in such studies. Our method compares the phenotypic covariance matrix of heterozygotes to homozygotes based on a Robust Omnibus Test. We refer to our method as the Parent of Origin Inference using Robust Omnibus Test (POIROT) of multiple quantitative traits.\n\nResultsThrough simulation studies, we compared POIROT to a competing univariate variance-based method which considers separate analysis of each phenotype. We observed POIROT to be well-calibrated with improved power to detect POEs compared to univariate methods. POIROT is robust to non-normality of phenotypes and can easily adjust for population stratification and other confounders.

This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane SNARE proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different critical positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1.

The color of each of these biosensors can be readily tuned by either changing the fluorescent protein or the synthetic fluorophore, which enabled to monitor simultaneously free NAD+ in different subcellular compartments upon genotoxic stress.

Oncogenic signal, such as overexpression of CyclinE, has been shown to induce replication stress.

Some of these stresses indeed reduce the fork rate, inhibiting DNA replication. Analyses of Chk1 activation in the cell population with western analyses showed that Chk1 activation by these stresses is largely dependent on Claspin. On the other hand, single cell analyses with Fucci cells indicated that while Chk1 activation during S phase is dependent on Claspin, that in G1 is mostly independent of Claspin. We propose that various biological stresses activate Chk1 either directly by stalling DNA replication fork or by some other mechanism that does not involve replication inhibition. The former pathway predominantly occurs in S phase and depends on Claspin, while the latter pathway, which may occur throughout the cell cycle, is largely independent of Claspin.\n\nOur findings provide evidence for novel links between replication stress checkpoint and other biological stresses and points to the presence of unknown mechanisms of Chk1 activation in mammalian cells.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.29.518268"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518269", "title": "The RNA binding proteins hnRNP H and F regulate splicing of a MYC dependent HRAS exon in Prostate Cancer Cells", "authors": "Chen, X.; Yang, H.

Malignant transformation by Myc transcriptionally upregulates the core pre-mRNA splicing machinery and causes mis-regulation of alternative splicing. However, our understanding of how splicing changes are directed by Myc is limited. We performed a signaling pathway-guided splicing analysis to identify Myc dependent splicing events. These included an HRAS cassette exon repressed by Myc across multiple tumor types. To molecularly dissect the regulation of this HRAS exon, we used antisense oligonucleotide tiling to identify splicing enhancers and silencers in its flanking introns. RNA binding motif prediction indicated multiple binding sites for hnRNP H and hnRNP F within these cis-regulatory elements. Using siRNA knockdown and cDNA expression, we found that both hnRNP H and F activate the HRAS cassette exon.\n\nMutagenesis and targeted RNA immunoprecipitation implicate two downstream G-rich elements in this splicing activation. Analyses of ENCODE RNA-seq datasets confirmed hnRNP H regulation of HRAS splicing. Analyses of RNA-seq datasets across multiple cancers showed a negative correlation of hnRNP H gene expression with Myc hallmark enrichment, consistent with the effect of hnRNP H on HRAS splicing. Interestingly, hnRNP F expression showed a positive correlation with Myc hallmarks and thus was not consistent with the observed effects of hnRNP F. Loss of hnRNP H/F altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Collectively, our results reveal new mechanisms for Myc-dependent regulation of splicing, and point to new possible therapeutic targets in prostate cancers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATMENTMyc Transformation by the proto-oncogene c-Myc causes dysregulation of the pre-mRNA splicing reaction in cancer, but it is not known how mRNA isoform changes are directed by Myc. Here, we use bioinformatics to identify a splicing event in another proto-oncogene, HRAS, that is regulated by Myc across multiple tumor types. We identify new splicing regulators, hnRNPs H and F, that control this HRAS exon by binding to enhancer elements within its downstream intron. Additional pan-cancer bioinformatic analyses show hnRNP H expression to be anti- correlated with Myc hallmarks, consistent with the reduced splicing of the HRAS exon in Myc driven cancer. These findings uncover new mechanisms by which Myc can alter splicing in cancer cells and provide new molecular targets for potential therapeutics.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/29/2022.11.29.518269"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518390", "title": "NaWRKY3 is a master transcriptional regulator of defense network against Alternaria alternata in Nicotiana attenuata", "authors": "Xu, Z.; Zhang, S.; Wu, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jinsong Wu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "date": "2022-11-29", "category": "molecular biology", "abstract": "WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant defense responses against pathogens.

Combination of transcriptome, electrophoretic mobility shift, ChIP-qPCR and dual-LUC analyses, we uncovered that NaWRKY3 bound to many defense genes promoter and activated their expression. Target genes included: 1) lipoxygenases 3, ACC synthase 1 and ACC oxidase 1, three key enzyme genes for JA and ethylene biosynthesis which were critical for A. alternata resistance; 2) feruloyl-CoA 6-hydroxylase 1 (NaF6H1), the key enzyme gene for phytoalexins against A. alternata, scopoletin and scopolin; and 3) three A. alternata resistance genes, long non-coding RNA (LncRNA L2), NADPH oxidase (NaRboh D) and berberine bridge-like (NaBBL28). Silencing LncRNA L2 reduced A. alternata-induced levels of JA and NaF6H1 expression. NaRboh D-silenced plants were strongly impaired in ROS production and stomata closure responses. NaBBL28 was the first A. alternata resistance BBLs identified and was involved in HGL-DTGs hydroxylation. Finally, NaWRKY3 could bind to its own promoter but acted as a transcriptional repressor. Thus we demonstrated that NaWRKY3 is a fine-tuned master regulator of defense network against A. alternata in N. attenuata by regulating different signaling pathways and defense metabolites.

Typical treatment of early-stage head and neck cancers includes either surgery or radiotherapy; however, advanced cases often require surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Salivary gland damage following radiotherapy leads to severe and chronic hypofunction with decreased salivary output, xerostomia, impaired ability to chew and swallow, increased risk of developing oral mucositis, and malnutrition. There is currently no standard of care for radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction and treatment is often limited to palliative treatment that provides only temporary relief. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that activates catabolic processes and has been shown to influence the cell cycle, proliferation, and autophagy. In the present study, we found that radiation (IR) treatment decreases tissue levels of phosphorylated AMPK following radiation and decreases intracellular NAD+ and AMP while increasing intracellular ATP. Further, expression of Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) were lower five days following IR. Treatment with AMPK activators, AICAR and metformin, attenuated compensatory proliferation (days 6, 7 and 30) following IR, and reversed chronic (day 30) salivary gland dysfunction post-IR. Additionally, treatment with metformin or AICAR increased markers of apical/basolateral polarity (phosphorylated aPKC{zeta}T560 positive area) and differentiation (amylase positive area) within irradiated parotid glands to levels similar to untreated controls.

THP-1 monocytic cells were differentiated into macrophages through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).

AFM viscoelastic mapping revealed an increased stiffness and more solid-like behavior of differentiated macrophages, especially in the lamellipodia and microvilli regions. Differentiated cells revealed an important increase of the apparent Youngs modulus (E0) and a decrease of cell fluidity ({beta}) on differentiated cells, which correlated with an increase in adhesion area. Macrophages with a spreading phenotype enhanced these changes. Remarkably, when adhesion was eliminated, differentiated macrophages remained stiffer and more solid-like than monocytes, suggesting a permanent reorganization of the cytoskeleton.

This type of interspecies comparison may be useful for identifying conserved computational principles of movement that guide human and veterinary medicine, plus several other fields of research. It is therefore important that research develops a system for quantifying movement in freely moving animals in natural environments and relating it to length and quality of life.

Understanding the pathogenesis and biomarkers associated with responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain critical components in developing effective therapeutic approaches, especially in cases of severe and long-COVID-19. In this study blood plasma protein expression was compared in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease. Evaluation of an inflammatory protein panel confirms upregulation of proteins including TNF{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, already associated with severe cytokine storm and progression to severe COVID-19. Importantly, we identify several proteins not yet associated with COVID-19 disease, including mesothelin (MSLN), that are expressed at significantly higher levels in severe COVID-19 subjects. In addition, we find a subset of markers associated with T-cell and dendritic cell responses to viral infection that are significantly higher in mild cases and decrease in expression as severity of COVID-19 increases, suggesting that an immediate and effective activation of T-cells is critical in modulating disease progression.

The conventional development process for aptamers utilizes a manual process known as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), which is costly, slow, dependent on library choice and often produces aptamers that are not optimized.

We have previously found that YTHDF1 regulates depolarization-induced protein synthesis by promoting translation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified transcripts5. Here we report an unexpected mechanism that the stimuli-induced neuronal translation is mediated by phosphorylation of a YTHDF1-binding protein FMRP. Phosphorylation of FMRP serine 499 induced by neuronal depolarization alters the condensing behavior of prion-like protein YTHDF1. Unphosphorylated FMRP sequesters YTHDF1 away from the translation initiation complex, whereas the stimulation-induced FMRP phosphorylation releases YTHDF1 to form translational active condensates with the ribosome to activate translation of YTHDF1 target transcripts. In fragile X syndrome (FXS) models characterized by low FMRP expression, we observed YTHDF1-mediated hyperactive translation, which notably impacts FXS pathophysiology. Developmental defects in an FXS forebrain organoid model could be reversed by a selective small-molecule inhibitor of YTHDF1 which acts by suppressing its condensation in neurons. We characterized transcriptome-wide mRNA translation with inhibitor treatment in organoids and identified targets that explain alleviated FXS pathology. Our study thus reveals FMRP and its phosphorylation as an important regulator of the activity-dependent translation during neuronal development and stimulation, and identifies YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target for FXS in which developmental defects caused by FMRP depletion could be reversed through YTHDF1 inhibition.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/30/2022.11.29.518448"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518522", "title": "A putative design for electromagnetic activation of split proteins for molecular and cellular manipulation", "authors": "Grady, C.

The position of the polyA tail can vary, with multiple alternatively polyadenylated (APA) transcripts existing for a single gene. This can lead to different length transcripts which can vary in their 3 regulatory domains and even by inclusion or exclusion of protein-coding introns. The distribution of polyA tail location on articular chondrocyte transcripts has not been examined before and this study aimed to be the first to define polyadenylation events in human chondrocytes using age-matched healthy and osteoarthritic knee articular cartilage samples. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples and analysed using the QuantSeqReverse 3 RNA Sequencing approach, where each read runs 3 to 5 from within the polyA tail into the transcript and will contains a distinct polyA site. Initial analysis of differential expression of overall transcript abundance identified by the reads showed significant disruption to transcript levels when healthy samples were compared to osteoarthritic ones. As we expected, differentially regulated genes were enriched with functionalities that were strongly associated with joint pathology. As part of this analysis, we also identified a substantial number of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs that had not been linked to osteoarthritis before. Subsequent examination of polyA site data allowed us to deifne the extent of site usage across all the samples. This included identification of chondrocyte genes that exhibited the greatest amount polyA site variation. When comparing healthy and osteoarthritic samples, we found that differential use of polyadenylation sites was modest. However, of the small number of genes affected, there was clear potential for the change in polyadenylation site usage elicited by pathology to have functional relevance. We examined two genes, OSMR and KMT2A, in more detail, defining how APA affects transcript turnover and then, in the case of OSMR, identifying that APA is sensitive to inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Overall, we have characterised the polyadenylation landscape of human knee articular chondrocytes but can conclude that osteoarthritis does not elicit a widespread change in their polyadenylation site usage. This finding differentiates knee osteoarthritis from pathologies such as cancer where APA is more commonly observed.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/30/2022.11.30.518535"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518476", "title": "Regulation of replicative histone RNA metabolism by the histone chaperone ASF1", "authors": "Almouzni, G.; Mendiratta, S.; Ray-Gallet, D.; Gatto, A.; Lemaire, S.; Kerlin, M.

A biological role for RNA binding in regulating PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity is generally accepted, but the nature and mechanism of this relationship remains an area of active investigation. Notably, many in vitro studies demonstrate that RNA inhibits PRC2 activity on nucleosomes through mutually antagonistic binding, while some in vivo studies indicate that PRC2s RNA-binding activity is critical for facilitating its biological function(s). Here we use biochemical, biophysical, and computational approaches to interrogate PRC2s RNA and DNA binding kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that PRC2-polynucleotide dissociation rates are dependent on the concentration of free ligand, indicating the potential for direct transfer between ligands without a free-enzyme intermediate. Direct transfer explains the variation in dissociation kinetics reported previously, allows reconciliation of prior in vitro and in vivo studies, and expands the potential mechanisms of RNA-mediated PRC2 regulation. Moreover, simulations indicate that such a direct transfer mechanism could be obligatory for RNA to recruit proteins to chromatin.\n\nSignificanceStudies of PRC2 in vitro indicate that RNA inhibits its histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity through mutually antagonistic binding with nucleosomes, but some in vivo studies paradoxically suggest that RNA binding is necessary to facilitate chromatin occupancy and HMTase activity.

Simulations suggested that such a direct transfer mechanism may be generally necessary for RNA to recruit proteins to chromatin, but the prevalence of direct transfer capability is unknown. Herein, we used fluorescence polarization assays and observed direct transfer for several well-characterized nucleic acid-binding proteins: three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, Fem-3-binding factor 2, and MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. For TREX1, the direct transfer mechanism was additionally interrogated by single molecule assays, and the data suggest that direct transfer occurs through an unstable ternary intermediate with partially associated ligands. Generally, direct transfer could allow many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins to conduct a one-dimensional search for their target sites. Furthermore, presumably long-lived protein-polynucleotide complexes might instead be readily replaced by other protein-polynucleotide complexes in vivo.\n\nSignificanceClassically, the lifetime of a protein-ligand complex is presumed to be an intrinsic property, unaffected by competitor molecules in free solution. By contrast, a few oligomeric nucleic acid binding proteins have been observed to exchange competing ligands in their binding sites, and consequently their lifetimes decrease with competitor concentration. Our findings indicate that this \"direct transfer\" is a more general property of nucleic acid binding proteins. This suggests that many DNA- and RNA-binding proteins can reduce the dimensionality of their search for their target sites by intramolecular direct transfer to nucleosome DNA, instead of relying entirely on three-dimensional diffusion, and it suggests that their mean complex lifetimes in vivo can be regulated by the concentration of free ligand molecules.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/30/2022.11.30.518605"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518220", "title": "A regulatory toolkit of arabinose-inducible artificial transcription factors for Gram-negative bacteria", "authors": "Naseri, G.; Raasch, H.; Charpentier, E.; Erhardt, M.", "author_corresponding": "Gita Naseri", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max planck unit for the science of pathogens", "date": "2022-11-30", "category": "synthetic biology", "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli are important model organisms, powerful prokaryotic expression platforms for biotechnological applications, and pathogenic strains constitute major public health threats.

Long disordered regions of low sequence complexity (LCRs) are a common feature of proteins that form liquid-like microscopic biomolecular condensates. In particular, RNA-binding proteins with prion-like composition have been highlighted as key drivers of liquid demixing to form condensates such as the nucleolus, paraspeckles and stress granules. Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein essential for DNA repair and paraspeckle formation. SFPQ contains two LCRs of different length and composition. Here, we show that the shorter C-terminal LCR of SFPQ is the main region responsible for the condensation of SFPQ in vitro and in the cell nucleus. In contrast, we find that, unexpectedly, the longer N-terminal prion-like LCR of SFPQ actually attenuates condensation of the full-length protein, suggesting a more regulatory role in preventing aberrant condensate formation in the cell.

ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a major role in the diversification of the Kruppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily, which predominates in tetrapod genomes. At present, it is unknown whether this function and co-evolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs, or a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver in the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from more than 4000 animal genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution, both within and between major taxonomic groups. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in a diverse set of representative animal species. We further investigate one of the most expansive ZNF subfamilies found in cyprinid fish, which are characterized by a conserved domain we dubbed the Fish N-terminal Zinc-finger associated (FiNZ) domain. FiNZ-ZNFs have dramatically expanded in several fish species, including the zebrafish in which we predict ~700 FiNZ-ZNF genes. Almost all are located on the long arm of chromosome 4, and recent duplicates are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, the bulk of zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed in waves at the onset of zygotic genome activation. Blocking FiNZ-ZNF translation using morpholinos during early zebrafish embryogenesis results in a global de-repression of young, transcriptionally active TEs, likely driven by the failure to establish heterochromatin over these elements. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution and that families of ZNFs have been deployed independently in fish and mammals to repress TEs during early embryogenesis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/30/2022.11.29.518450"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518511", "title": "Targeting of MMP-13 prevents aortic aneurysm formation in Marfan mice", "authors": "Zimmermann, L.-M.

This analysis revealed enriched contacts at sites bound by many factors associated with active transcription. We show that active regulatory elements, independent of cohesin and polycomb, interact with each other across distances of 10s of megabases in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes and that interactions correlate and change with activity.

As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In this study, we present the \"multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test\" (mvMAPIT) -- a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact -- thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search-based methods. Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate mvMAPIT as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized GWA studies. With simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvMAPIT over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies. We also apply mvMAPIT framework to protein sequence data from two broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies and approximately 2,000 heterogenous stock of mice from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.

Earlier, four candidate genes for Rph7 were reported and, despite an in-depth comparative sequence analysis and haplotypic characterisation, the causal gene could not be resolved. Here, we successfully cloned Rph7 utilising a fine mapping approach in combination with an RNA-Seq based expression analysis. We identified three up-regulated and pathogen-induced genes with presence/absence variation (PAV) at this locus. Sequence analysis of chemically induced Rph7 knockout mutant lines identified multiple independent non-synonymous variants, including a premature stop codon in a single non-canonical resistance gene that encodes a 302-amino acid protein.

All cases of FOP are caused by mutations in the type I BMP receptor gene ACVR1 that result in over-activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Activation of the wild-type ACVR1 kinase requires assembly of a tetrameric type I and II BMP receptor complex followed by phosphorylation of the ACVR1 GS domain by type II BMP receptors. Previous studies showed that the FOP mutant ACVR1-R206H requires type II BMP receptors and presumptive GS domain phosphorylation for over-active signaling. Structural modeling of the FOP-ACVR1 mutant kinase domain supports that FOP mutations alter the conformation of the GS domain, but it is unclear how this leads to overactive signaling. Here we show using a developing zebrafish embryo BMP signaling assay that the FOP mutant receptors ACVR1-R206H and -G328R have reduced requirements for GS domain phosphorylation sites to signal compared to wild-type ACVR1. Further, ligandindependent and ligand-dependent signaling through the FOP ACVR1 receptors have distinct GS domain phosphorylation site requirements. Moreover, ACVR1-G328 showed increased GS domain serine/threonine requirements for ligand-independent signaling compared to ACVR1-R206H, whereas it exhibited reduced serine/threonine requirements for ligand-dependent signaling. Remarkably, while ACVR1-R206H does not require the type I BMP receptor partner, Bmpr1, to signal, a ligand-dependent GS domain mutant of ACVR1-R206H could signal independently of Bmpr1 only when Bmp7 ligand was overexpressed. Of note, unlike human ACVR1-R206H, the zebrafish paralog Acvr1l-R203H does not show increased signaling activity. However, in domain-swapping studies the human kinase domain, but not the human GS domain, was sufficient to confer overactive signaling to the Acvr1l-R203H receptor. Together these results reflect the importance of GS domain activation and kinase domain functions in regulating ACVR1 signaling and identify mechanisms of reduced regulatory constraints conferred by FOP mutations.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/01/2022.12.01.518722"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.01.518327", "title": "Mechanism of receptor assembly via the pleiotropic adipokine Leptin", "authors": "Tsirigotaki, A.; Dansercoer, A.; Verschueren, K.

While p110 is critically involved in pathogenic vascular remodeling, its physiological role for vascular integrity under stress conditions has not been studied. We report a protective function of smooth muscle p110 against abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation.\n\nMethods & ResultsIn mice lacking p110 in smooth muscle cells (sm-p110-/-), perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) yielded substantially enhanced AAA formation compared to wild type controls. This disease phenotype is partly attributable to a subtle preexisting vascular phenotype under basal conditions, as sm-p110-/- mice displayed a smaller media area, deranged aortic wall structure (detached smooth muscle cells, increased apoptotic cell death), and a diminished functional responsiveness of aortic rings to vasodilators. Furthermore, p110 is also implicated in regenerative processes during AAA development: Whereas wild type mice showed increased media hypertrophy, neointima formation and proliferation upon PPE intervention, these vascular remodeling processes were diminished in sm-p110-/- mice. Concomitantly, increased numbers of elastic fiber breaks and ECM degradation were detected in sm-p110-/- aorta. Mechanistically, we found that lack of p110 expression impaired smooth muscle cell proliferation, expression of contractile marker genes and production of elastin fibers. This phenotype largely depended on reduced phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO1, as specific FOXO1 inhibition fully rescued proliferation of p110-/- smooth muscle cells, and knockdown of FOXO1 increased expression of calponin and elastin.\n\nConclusionsSmooth muscle p110 protects against AAA disease by maintaining aortic wall homoeostasis and promoting SMC proliferation to compensate for cell loss during AAA development.

In theory, flanking transgenes with insulators protects them from position effects, but in practice, efforts to insulate transgenes meet with mixed success because the contextual requirements for insulator function in the genome are not well understood. A key question is whether insulators are modular elements that can function anywhere in the genome or whether they are adapted to function only in certain genomic locations.

In this generation of rational D-CONGA variants, we tested multiple sequence-function hypotheses that had not been tested in previous generations. Many of the peptide variants tested have lower antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially those that have altered hydrophobicity, secondary structure potential, or spatial distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues. Thus, D-CONGA is generally well tuned for good antimicrobial activity. However, we identified one variant, D-CONGA-Q7, with a polar glutamine inserted into the middle of the sequence, that has higher activity against both planktonic and biofilm-forming bacteria and lower cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts.

However, relatively little is known about how defective import contributes to neurodegeneration, or how neurotoxic proteins characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases impact mitochondrial import efficiency. Here, we used HeLa cells to investigate how expressing high levels of Tau variants affect mitochondrial import activity, morphology, and function. We found that the variant associated with neurodegeneration (TauP301L) colocalises with mitochondria. TauP301L, but not wildtype Tau, interacts with TOM40, the protein-channel component of the outer membrane protein import complex. Interestingly, TauP301L expression had no discernible effect on overall mitochondrial import function, despite associating with TOM40 and altering mitochondrial morphology, suggesting that a rescue mechanism is at play. This rescue could be explained by the appearance of microtubule and actin containing tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), used to recruit healthy mitochondria from neighbouring cells and/or dispose of mitochondria with aggregated Tau. Furthermore, in primary neuronal cultures TauP301L induces morphological changes that resemble a neurodegeneration like phenotype, and this is mirrored in cells where the import sites are blocked artificially.

Nuclear mechanical components chromatin and lamins maintain nuclear shape, compartmentalization, and function by resisting antagonistic actin contraction and confinement. However, studies have yet to compare chromatin and lamins perturbations side-by-side as well as modulated actin contraction while holding confinement constant. To accomplish this, we used NLS-GFP to measure nuclear shape and rupture in live cells with chromatin decompaction (VPA), loss of lamin B1 (LMNB1-/-), and loss of lamin A/C (LMNA-/-). We then modulated actin contraction while maintaining actin confinement measured by nuclear height. Wild type, chromatin decompaction, and lamin B1 null present bleb-based nuclear deformations and ruptures dependent on actin contraction and independent of actin confinement. Inhibition of actin contraction by Y27632 decreased nuclear blebbing and ruptures to near 0% of cells while activation of actin contraction by CN03 increased the frequency of ruptures by nearly two-fold. However, lamin A/C null results in overall abnormal shape, but similar blebs and ruptures as wild type which were unaffected by actin contraction modulation. Actin contraction control of nuclear shape and ruptures showed that DNA damage levels were more correlated with perturbed nuclear shape than they were with changes in nuclear ruptures. We reveal that lamin B1 is a chromatin decompaction phenotype because using GSK126, which mimics the loss of facultative heterochromatin in lamin B1 null, is sufficient to phenocopy increased nuclear blebbing and ruptures. Furthermore, even though blebs and ruptures in lamin A/C null cells are insensitive to actin contraction, they do have the capacity to form increased levels of nuclear blebs and bleb-based ruptures, shown by treating with VPA.

A potential mechanism for cells to decide the timing of division is the differential scaling of regulatory protein copy numbers with cell size. However, it remains unclear whether such a mechanism can lead to robust growth and division, and how the scaling behaviors of regulatory proteins affect the cell size distribution. In this study, we formulate a mathematical model combining gene expression and cell growth, in which the cell-cycle inhibitors scale sublinearly with cell size while the activators scale superlinearly. The cell divides once the ratio of their concentrations reaches a threshold value. We find that the cell can robustly grow and divide within a finite range of the threshold value. Intriguingly, the cell size at birth is proportional to the ploidy, in agreement with experiments. In a stochastic version of the model, the cell size at division is uncorrelated with that at birth. Also, the more differential the cell-size scaling of the cell-cycle regulators is, the narrower the cell-size distribution is. Finally, after the deletion of a regulator, the average cell size can change significantly while the coefficient of variation of cell size remains roughly the same, consistent with experimental observations.\n\nAuthor summaryHow cells determine the timing of cell division is a fundamental question of cell biology. It has been found that the concentration of cell-cycle activators tends to increase with cell size, while the concentration of inhibitors tends to decrease. Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that the ratio of activators to inhibitors may trigger cell division. To investigate this hypothesis quantitatively, we formulate a model including gene expression and cell growth simultaneously. The cell divides once the activator-to-inhibitor ratio reaches a threshold. Combining theories and simulations, we analyze the conditions of robust cell cycle and the cell size distribution.

The stereotypical nature of these changes can be modeled to produce epigenetic clocks capable of predicting biological age with unprecedented accuracy. Despite the predictive ability of epigenetic clocks, the underlying processes that produce clock signals are not resolved but are hypothesized to be rooted in stochastic processes leading to an erosion in the epigenetic landscape. Here, we test this hypothesis using a novel computational approach for measuring disorder in DNA methylation patterns across the epigenome. We find that loci comprising conventional epigenetic clocks are enriched in regions that both accumulate and lose disorder with age, suggesting a direct link between DNA methylation disorder and epigenetic clock signals. Across the murine lifespan, disorder accumulates in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes and decreases in CTCF and transcription factor binding sites, resulting in genomic hotspots of age-related epigenetic disorder. We further investigate the connections between age-related changes in disorder and epigenetic clock signals by comparing the influences of development, lifespan interventions, and cellular dedifferentiation using a series of newly developed epigenetic clocks based on regional disorder, average methylation states, and commonly used measures of entropy. We identify both common responses as well as critical differences between canonical epigenetic clocks and those based on regional disorder, demonstrating a fundamental decoupling of epigenetic aging processes.

In some animals and a few distantly related unicellular species, cellular aggregation is regulated by diffusible chemical cues. However, it is unclear whether regulated cellular aggregation was part of the life cycles of the first multicellular animals and/or their unicellular ancestors. To fill this gap, we investigated the triggers of cellular aggregation in one of animals closest unicellular living relatives - the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki. We discovered that Capsaspora aggregation is induced by chemical cues, as observed in some of the earliest branching animals and other unicellular species. Specifically, we found that calcium ions and lipids present in lipoproteins function together to induce aggregation of viable Capsaspora cells. We also found that this multicellular stage is reversible, as depletion of the cues triggers disaggregation, which can be overcome upon re-induction. Our finding demonstrates that chemically regulated aggregation is important across diverse members of the holozoan clade. Therefore, this phenotype was plausibly integral to the life cycles of the unicellular ancestors of animals.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/01/2022.12.01.517680"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518400", "title": "Establishing cell motility patterns as predictors of macrophage subtypes and their relation to cell morphology", "authors": "Kesapragada, M.; Sun, Y.-H.; Recendez, C.; Fregoso, D.; Yang, H.-y.; Isseroff, R.

Cell size and shape have been informative in defining macrophage subtypes, but their link to motility properties is unknown, despite M1 and M2 macrophages exhibiting distinct migratory behaviors, in vitro, in 3D and in vivo. We apply both morphology and motility-based image processing approaches to analyze live cell images consisting of macrophage phenotypes. Macrophage subtypes are differentiated from primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages using a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). We show that morphology is tightly linked to motility, which leads to our hypothesis that motility analysis could be used alone or in conjunction with morphological features for improved prediction of macrophage subtypes. We train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict macrophage subtypes based on morphology alone, motility alone, and both morphology and motility combined. We show that motility has comparable predictive capabilities as morphology. However, using both measures can enhance predictive capabilities. While motility and morphological features can be individually ambiguous identifiers, together they provide significantly improved prediction accuracies (>79%) using only phase contrast time-lapse microscopy and a small unique cell count for training ([~]250). Thus, the approach combining cell motility and cell morphology information can accurately assess functionally diverse macrophage phenotypes quickly and efficiently. Our approach offers a cost efficient and high through-put method for screening biochemicals targeting macrophage polarization with small datasets.\n\nSignificancePrevious work has shown that macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their morphological characteristics. We extend this work to show that distinct motility patterns are linked to macrophage morphology. Thus, motility patterns can be used to differentiate phenotypes. This can enable high-throughput classification of cell phenotypes without regard for the high-resolution images needed to back out morphological characteristics.

The size of the Y chromosome assemblies vary extensively from 45.2 to 84.9 Mbp, with individual repeat arrays showing up to 6.7-fold difference in length across samples. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large (up to 5.94 Mbp) inversions with a >2-fold higher recurrence rate compared to the rest of the human genome. The Y centromere, composed of 171 bp -satellite monomer units, appears to have evolved from tandem arrays of a 36-mer ancestral higher order repeat (HOR), which has been predominantly replaced by a 34-mer HOR, and reveals a pattern of higher sequence variation towards the short-arm side.

We sought to investigate how communication between extracellular stress and chromatin structure may regulate cellular mechanical behaviors. We demonstrate that the linker histone H1.0, which compacts nucleosomes into higher order chromatin fibers, controls genome organization and cellular stress response. Histone H1.0 has privileged expression in fibroblasts across tissue types in mice and humans, and modulation of its expression is necessary and sufficient to mount a myofibroblast phenotype in these cells. Depletion of histone H1.0 prevents transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta})-induced fibroblast contraction, proliferation and migration in a histone H1 isoform-specific manner via inhibition of a transcriptome comprised of extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal and contractile genes. Histone H1.0 is associated with local regulation of gene expression via mechanisms involving chromatin fiber compaction and reprogramming of histone acetylation, rendering the cell stiffer in response to cytokine stimulation. Knockdown of histone H1.0 prevented locus-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation by TGF-{beta} and decreased levels of both HDAC1 and the chromatin reader BRD4, thereby preventing transcription of a fibrotic gene program. Transient depletion of histone H1.0 in vivo decompacts chromatin and prevents fibrosis in cardiac muscle, thereby linking chromatin structure with fibroblast phenotype in response to extracellular stress.

The occurrence of gene conversion and mutations during meiosis may further be influenced by the chromatin conformation, in analogy to what is known for mutations during mitosis. To date, however, the exact distribution and type of meiosis-associated changes and the role of the chromatin conformation in this context is largely unexplored. Here, we determine recombination, gene conversion, and de novo mutations using whole-genome sequencing of all meiotic products of 23 individual meioses in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important pathogen of wheat. We could confirm a high genome-wide recombination rate of 65 cM/Mb and see higher recombination rates on the accessory compared to core chromosomes. A substantial fraction of 0.16% of all polymorphic markers was affected by gene conversions, showing a weak GC-bias, and occurring at higher frequency in regions of constitutive heterochromatin, indicated by the histone modification H3K9me3. The de novo mutation rate associated with meiosis was approx. three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding mitotic mutation rate. Importantly, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences, is active in Z. tritici and responsible for the majority of these de novo meiotic mutations. Our results indicate that the genetic changes associated with meiosis are a major source of variability in the genome of an important plant pathogen and shape its evolutionary trajectory.\n\nImportanceThe impact of meiosis on the genome composition via gene conversion and mutations is mostly poorly understood, in particular for non-model species. Here, we sequenced all four meiotic products for 23 individual meioses and determined the genetic changes caused by meiosis for the important fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We found a high rate of gene conversions and an effect of the chromatin conformation on gene conversion rates. Higher conversion rates were found in regions enriched with the H3K9me3 - a mark for constitutive heterochromatin. Most importantly, meiosis was associated with a much higher frequency of de novo mutations than mitosis. 78% of the meiotic mutations were caused by repeat-induced point mutations - a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences.

Sequence data from ancient individuals also have unique characteristics, including short fragments, increased sequencing-error rates, and often limited genome-coverage that poses further challenges. Here we present a novel and conceptually simple approach for assessing questions of population continuity among a temporally distributed sample. We note that conditional on heterozygote sites in an individual genome at a particular point in time, the mean proportion of derived variants at those sites in other individuals has different expectations forwards in time and backwards in time. The difference in these processes enables us to construct a statistic that can detect population continuity in a temporal sample of genomes. We can show that the statistic is sensitive to historical admixture events from unsampled populations. Simulations are used to evaluate the power of this approach.

The extracellular matrix composition of articular cartilage mainly consists of glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II. Specifically the collagen type II organization has a characteristic organization in three distinct zones; (1) the superficial zone which has collagen fibers oriented parallel to the surface, (2) the intermediate zone where there is no predominant orientation, and (3) the deep zone which shows a high orientation with fibers perpendicular to the underlying bone. Collagen type II fibers in these 3 zones take an arch-like organization that can be mimicked with segments of a hypotrochoidal curve. In this study, a script was developed that allowed the fabrication of scaffolds with a hypotrochoidal design. This design was investigated and compared to a regular 0-90 woodpile design. The results showed that the hypotrochoidal design was successfully fabricated. Micro-CT analyses divided the areas of the scaffold in their distinct zones. In addition, the mechanical analyses revealed that the hypotrochoidal design had a lower component Young's modulus while the toughness and strain at yield were higher compared to the woodpile design. Fatigue tests showed that the hypotrochoidal design lost more energy per cycle due to the damping effect of the unique microarchitecture . Finite element analyses revealed that the hypotrochoidal design had an improved stress distribution compared to the 0-90 woodpile design due to the lower component stiffness. In addition, data from cell culture under dynamic stimulation demonstrated that the collagen type II deposition was improved in the hypotrochoidal design. Finally, Alcian blue staining revealed that the areas where the stress was higher during the stimulation produced more glycosaminoglycans. Our results highlight a new and simple scaffold design based on hypotrochoidal curves that could be used for cartilage tissue engineering.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.11.29.518172"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518509", "title": "Finemap-MiXeR: A variational Bayesian approach for genetic finemapping", "authors": "Akdeniz, B.

Our approach is based on the optimization of Evidence Lower Bound of the likelihood function obtained from the MiXeR model.

In comparison to the FINEMAP and SuSiE methods, we observed that Finemap-MiXeR in most cases has better accuracy.

We believe that such intricate scenarios are better modeled with additional indicative information that reflects their multi-modality nature and multi-scale functionality.

We first studied the effect of multigenerational diet on the mechanical properties, adipocyte size, and collagen structure of these mouse breast tissues, and then, examined the migration and invasion behavior of normal (KTB-21) and cancerous (MDA-MB-231) human mammary epithelial cells on the decellularized matrices from each diet group.

A similar trend was observed with normal KTB-21 cells. Our results showed that the collagen curvature was the dominating factor on this enhanced motility and stretching the matrices to equalize the collagen fiber linearity of the matrices ameliorated the observed increase in cell migration and invasion in the mice that were exposed to a high-fat diet.

Recent work has modeled the effect of single point mutations on proteins by leveraging the information contained in large-scale, pretrained protein language models (PLMs). PLMs are often applied in a zero-shot setting, where the effect of each mutation is predicted based on the output of the language model with no additional training. However, this approach cannot appropriately model immune escape, which involves the interaction of two proteins--antibody and antigen--instead of one protein and requires making different predictions for the same antigenic mutation in response to different antibodies. Here, we explore several methods for predicting immune escape by building models on top of embeddings from PLMs. We evaluate our methods on a SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning dataset and show that our embedding-based methods significantly outperform zero-shot methods, which have almost no predictive power. We also highlight insights gained into how best to use embeddings from PLMs to predict escape. Despite these promising results, simple statistical and machine learning baseline models that do not use pretraining perform comparably, showing that computationally expensive pretraining approaches may not be beneficial for escape prediction. Furthermore, all models perform relatively poorly, indicating that future work is necessary to improve escape prediction with or without pretrained embeddings.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.11.30.518466"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.30.518575", "title": "Temporal Evolution of the HIV Viral Population under Drug Selection Pressure", "authors": "Choudhuri, I.; Biswas, A.; Haldane, A.; Levy, R.", "author_corresponding": "Ron Levy", "author_corresponding_institution": "Temple University", "date": "2022-12-02", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Drug resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a pervasive problem affecting the lives of millions of patients worldwide.

Using a plethora of synergistic computational approaches, we elucidate how conformational transitions between the active and inactive ABL states can employ allosteric regulatory switches to modulate the intramolecular communication networks between the ATP site, the substrate binding region, and the allosteric binding pocket. A perturbation-based network approach that implements mutational profiling of allosteric residue propensities and communications in the ABL states is proposed. Consistent with the biophysical experiments, the results reveal functionally significant shifts of the allosteric interaction networks in which preferential communication paths between the ATP binding site and substrate regions in the active ABL state become suppressed in the closed inactive ABL form, which in turn features favorable allosteric couplings between the ATP site and the allosteric binding pocket. By integrating the results of atomistic simulations with dimensionality reduction methods and Markov state models we analyze the mechanistic role of the macrostates and characterize kinetic transitions between the ABL conformational states. Using network-based mutational scanning of allosteric residue propensities, this study provides a comprehensive computational analysis of the long-range communications in the ABL kinase domain and identifies conserved regulatory hotspots that modulate kinase activity and allosteric cross-talk between the allosteric pocket, ATP binding site and substrate binding regions.

Flow can occur through a combination of extrinsic pumping, due to forces from surrounding tissues, and intrinsic pumping involving contractions of muscle in the lymphatic vessel walls.

Lymphatic muscle cells exhibit cardiac-like phasic contractions to generate flow and smooth-muscle-like tonic contractions to regulate flow. Lymphatic vessels therefore act as both active pumps and conduits. Lymphatic vessels are sensitive to mechanical stimuli, including flow-induced shear stresses and pressure-induced vessel stretch. These forces modulate biochemical pathways, leading to changes in intracellular calcium and interaction with regulatory and contractile proteins. In a multiscale computational model of phasic and tonic contractions in lymphatic muscle coupled to a lumped-parameter model of lymphatic pumping, we tested different models of the mechanical feedback mechanisms exhibited by lymphatics in experiments. Models were validated using flow and pressure experiments not used in the model construction.

In this work, we define a conformational ensemble as an ordered set of probability distributions and provide a suitable metric to detect differences between two given ensembles at the residue level, both locally and globally. The underlying geometry of the conformational space is properly integrated, being one ensemble characterized by a set of probability distributions supported on the three-dimensional Euclidean space (for global-scale comparisons) and on the two-dimensional flat torus (for local-scale comparisons).

A key part of this machinery is the association of ParB proteins to the parS-containing centromeric region to form the partition complex. Despite much work, the formation and structure of this nucleoprotein complex has remained unclear. However, it was recently discovered that CTP binding allows ParB dimers to entrap and slide along the DNA, as well as leading to more efficient condensation through ParB-mediated DNA bridging. Here, we use semi-flexible polymer simulations to show how these properties of sliding and bridging can explain partition complex formation. We find that transient ParB bridges can organise the DNA into either a globular state or into hairpins and helical structures, depending on the bridge lifetime. In separate stochastic simulations, we show that ParB sliding reproduces the experimentally measured multi-peaked binding profile of Caulobacter crescentus, indicating that bridging and other potential roadblocks are sufficiently short-lived that they do not hinder ParB spreading. Indeed, upon coupling the two simulation frameworks into a unified sliding and bridging model, we find that short-lived ParB bridges do not hinder ParB sliding and the model can reproduce both the ParB binding profile and the condensation of the nucleoprotein complex. Overall, our model clarifies the mechanism of partition complex formation and predicts its fine structure. We speculate that the DNA hairpins produced by ParB bridging underlie the secondary function of ParB to load the Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) complex onto the DNA.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.12.01.518708"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518855", "title": "Sfp1 integrates TORC1 and PKA activity towards yeast ribosome biogenesis", "authors": "Vuillemenot, L.-A.; Milias-Argeits, A.", "author_corresponding": "Andreas Milias-Argeits", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Groningen", "date": "2022-12-02", "category": "systems biology", "abstract": "Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) are two major regulators of cell growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coupling nutrient availability with resource-intensive anabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis.

This is the case for Sfp1, a transcriptional activator of hundreds of ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis genes. To disentangle the roles of PKA and TORC1 in Sfp1 regulation, we constructed a large collection of Sfp1 (phospho)mutants, and studied their intracellular localization and phosphorylation. Besides the already known TORC1 phosphorylation sites, we discovered that Sfp1 contains two PKA sites and a functional Nuclear Export Signal (NES) which is regulated by TORC1 and PKA. We further showed that TORC1 and PKA regulate Sfp1 phosphorylation independently of each other, with loss of activity of either pathway being sufficient to relocalize the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal zinc fingers being necessary for the responsiveness of Sfp1 to TORC1 and PKA inputs.

The aim of the present study was to reveal the proteome biology of dental implants affected with peri-implantitis.

Using sterile paper strips, samples were collected from healthy implants (I), healthy teeth (T) and peri-implantitis affected implants (P). Proteome analysis was performed using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data independent acquisition, allowing the identification and quantification of human and bacterial proteins as well as semi-specific peptides. Results: 38 samples from 13 patients were included in the study. 2332 different human proteins were identified across all samples. No differentially expressed proteins between T and I were found. Comparing P to I, 59 proteins were found upregulated and 31 downregulated in P with significance. Upregulated proteins included proinflammatory proteins such as immunoglobulins, dysferlin and S100P, as well as antimicrobial proteins, e.g. myeloperoxidase or azurocidin. Gene ontology analysis further revealed higher activity of immunological pathways. Proteolytic patterns indicated the activity of inflammatory proteins such as cathepsin G. 334 bacterial proteins were identified and quantified. Peri-implantitis showed elevated proteolytic activity.

However, when investigating the underlying model we found that the genetic estimator used by Ioannidis et al. [2021] is biased to be about 300 years too old. Correcting for this bias gives genetic settlement dates that are more recent than any dates consistent with archaeological records, as radiocarbon dating of human-modified artifacts shows settlement definitively earlier than the bias-corrected genetic estimates. These too-recent estimates can only be explained by substantial gene flow between islands after their initial settlements. Therefore, contacts attested by archaeological and linguistic evidence must have been accompanied also by demographically significant movement of people. This gene flow well after the initial settlements was not modelled by Ioannidis et al.

Numerous performance metrics have been developed for classification problems making it overwhelming to select the appropriate one since each of them represents a particular aspect of the model. Furthermore, selection of a performance metric becomes harder for problems with imbalanced and/or small datasets. Therefore, in clinical studies where datasets are frequently imbalanced and, in situations when the prevalence of a disease is low or the collection of patient samples is difficult, deciding on a suitable metric for performance evaluation of an ML model becomes quite challenging. The most common approach to address this problem is measuring multiple metrics and compare them to identify the best-performing ML model. However, comparison of multiple metrics is laborious and prone to user preference bias. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are also required by ML model optimization techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, where we train many models, each with different parameters, and compare their performances to identify the best-performing parameters. In such situations, it becomes almost impossible to assess different models by comparing multiple metrics. Here, we propose a new metric called Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) as a Python package for classification problems. MLcps combines multiple pre-computed performance metrics into one metric that conserves the essence of all pre-computed metrics for a particular model. We tested MLcps on 4 different publicly available biological datasets and the results reveal that it provides a comprehensive picture of overall model robustness.

Here, we introduce secure and federated genome-wide association studies (SF-GWAS), a novel combination of secure computation frameworks that empowers efficient and accurate GWAS in a federated manner, i.e., on private data locally-held by multiple entities, while provably ensuring end-to-end data confidentiality.

We ran SF-GWAS on five real GWAS datasets, including a large UK Biobank cohort of 410K individuals, thereby demonstrating the largest secure genetics collaboration to date. SF-GWAS achieves an order-of-magnitude runtime improvement over the prior art for PCA-based GWAS and newly allows secure LMM-based association tests, for which its runtime scales at a near-constant rate in cohort size.

It allows the detection of smaller differences than the previous biosensor in or at proximity of the MAMs. Noteworthy, we demonstrated that IP3-receptors have an endogenous activity which participate to the Ca2+ leak channel on the surface of the OMM during hypoxia or when SERCA activity is blocked.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.12.02.518840"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518374", "title": "Comparing Genomic and Epigenomic Features across Species Using the WashU Comparative Epigenome Browser", "authors": "Zhuo, X.; Hsu, S.; Purushotham, D.; Chen, S.; Li, D.; Wang, T.", "author_corresponding": "Ting Wang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Washington University School of Medicine", "date": "2022-12-02", "category": "genomics", "abstract": "Genome browsers have become an intuitive and critical tool to visualize and analyze genomic features and data.

Instead of anchoring all datasets to the reference genome coordinates, it creates independent coordinates of different genome assemblies to faithfully present features and data mapped to different genomes. It uses a simple, intuitive genome-align track to illustrate the syntenic relationship between different species. It extends the widely used WashU Epigenome Browser infrastructure and can be expanded to support multiple species.

At the nuclear periphery, suppressed chromatin overlapping with repetitive sequences and inactive protein-coding genes are enriched. At a chromosomal level, plant chromatin organization in interphase nuclei displays flexibilities in response to various developmental cues and environmental stimuli. Based on these observations in Arabidopsis, and given the role of AtNMCP genes (CRWN1 and CRWN4) in organizing chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery, one can expect considerable changes in chromatin-NL interactions when the global chromatin organization patterns are being altered in plants.

Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to involve in HSC activation, but its association with succinate in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the role of gemigliptin, an antidiabetic DDP-4 inhibitor, in the succinate-induced ER stress and activation of HSCs. Methods: LX-2 cells, the immortalized human HSCs, were treated with succinate and gemigliptin. For animal experiments, C57BL/6N mice were divided into 3 groups: control diet, high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet, and HFHC diet mixed with gemigliptin. Results: Succinate significantly induced HSC activation and increased expression of inflammatory markers and the increase in the migration of HSCs. The treatment of succinate also caused ER dilation and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling as PERK, eIF2alpha, Bip, suggesting increasing ER stress in HSCs. All responses of HSCs to succinate were attenuated with the co-treatment of gemigliptin. Moreover, the exposure of HSCs to tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, promoted the expression of -SMA, proliferation and migration of HSCs. In vivo, the level of fibrotic and ER stress markers was increased in mice fed with HFHC diet and the administration of gemigliptin improved these changes in HFHC-induced mice. Conclusion: This study showed the involvement of ER stress in the activation of succinate-induced LX-2 HSCs and gemigliptin significantly reduced ER stress in HSC activation. Therefore, gemigliptin may become an anti-fibrotic agent and targeting to succinate and ER stress may be a promising therapeutic in the management of liver fibrosis.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/02/2022.12.01.518797"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.01.518806", "title": "Running Kinesin-1 shapes the microtubule acetylation gradient", "authors": "Andreu-Carbo, M.; Egoldt, C.; Velluz, M.-C.; Aumeier, C.", "author_corresponding": "Charlotte Aumeier", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Geneva", "date": "2022-12-02", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "The properties of single microtubules within the microtubule network can be modulated through posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation within the lumen of microtubules.

While in-depth, targeted experiments that determine the functions of these gene products are crucial and routinely performed, they fail to keep up with the inflow of novel genomic data. In an attempt to address this gap, high-throughput experiments are being conducted in which a large number of genes are investigated in a single study. The annotations generated as a result of these experiments are generally biased towards a small subset of less informative Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Identifying and removing biases from protein function annotation databases is important since biases impact our understanding of protein function by providing a poor picture of the annotation landscape. Additionally, as machine learning methods for predicting protein function are becoming increasingly prevalent, it is essential that they are trained on unbiased datasets. Therefore, it is not only crucial to be aware of biases, but also to judiciously remove them from annotation datasets.

Methods: RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis were performed on banked paraffin embedded diagnostic samples from each disease. Results: The transcriptomic profiles of Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease were found to share a remarkable overlap, which did not extend to other common inflammatory skin diseases, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Analysis of enriched pathways showed a shared upregulation in keratinocyte differentiation and Th17 inflammatory pathways, and a decrease in cell adhesion and actin organization pathways in Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease. Direct comparison to atopic dermatitis and psoriasis showed that the downregulation in actin organization pathways was a unique feature in Darier, Hailey-Hailey, and Grover's disease. Further, upstream regulator analysis suggests that a decrease in SRF/MRTF activity may be responsible for the downregulation of actin organization pathways. Staining for MRTFA in lesional skin samples showed a decrease in nuclear MRTFA in patient skin compared to normal skin.

We present the first comprehensive study of histone-lysine and DNA methyltransferases across the Mucoromycota, uncovering H3K9-methylated heterochromatin as the major chromatin modification repressing transcription in these fungi, which lack both Polycomb silencing and cytosine methylation. Although RNA interference (RNAi) facilitates the formation of heterochromatin in many eukaryotic organisms, we show that RNAi is not required to maintain either genomic or centromeric heterochromatin in Mucor. H3K9-methylation and RNAi act independently to control centromeric regions, suggesting a functional sub-specialization. Whereas the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and heterochromatin formation are essential for cell viability, RNAi is dispensable for viability yet acts as the main epigenetic, regulatory force repressing transposition of GremLINE1 elements. Mutations inactivating canonical RNAi lead to rampant transposition and insertional inactivation of targets resulting in antimicrobial drug resistance. This fine-tuned, Rdrp2-dependent RNAi activity is critical for genome stability, restricting GremLINE1 transposable elements to the centromeres where they occupy long heterochromatic islands. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi and heterochromatin formation are independent genome defense and regulatory mechanisms in the Mucorales, contributing to a paradigm shift from the co-transcriptional gene silencing observed in fission yeasts to models in which heterochromatin and RNAi operate independently in early-diverging basal fungi.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.01.518749"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518810", "title": "Biomechanical characterisation of thoracic ascending aorta with preserved pre-stresses", "authors": "Parikh, S.; Moerman, K.

To this purpose, several force spectroscopy approaches aim at measuring the adhesive forces between two living cells and also between a cell and a suitable reproduction of the extracellular matrix (ECM), typically exploiting tips suitably functionalised with single components (e.g. collagen, fibronectin) of the ECM. However, these probes only poorly reproduce the complexity of the native cellular microenvironment and consequently of the biological interactions. We developed a novel approach to produce AFM probes that faithfully reproduce the structural and biochemical complexity of the ECM; this was achieved by attaching to an AFM cantilever a micrometric slice of native decellularised ECM cut by laser microdissection, and preserving the full morphological, mechanical, and chemical heterogeneity of the ECM. These native ECM probes can be used in force spectroscopy experiments aimed at targeting cell-microenvironment interactions. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of dissecting mechanotransductive cell-ECM interactions in the 10 pN range. As proof-of-principle, we tested a rat bladder ECM probe against the AY-27 rat bladder cancer cell line. On the one hand, we obtained reproducible results using different probes derived from the same ECM regions; on the other hand, we detected differences in the adhesion patterns of distinct bladder ECM regions, such as submucosa and detrusor, in line with the disparities in composition and biophysical properties of these ECM regions.

Methods and results: The human ventricular myocytes model in this study followed the ten Tussucher's model in 2006, and the bio-pacemaker single cell model was modified based on it as what has been expatiated in our previous work. In tissue model, two factors were primarily evaluated for their effects on bio-pacemakers to pace and drive surrounding cardiac tissue: gap junction between bio-pacemaker cells (PMs) and adjacent ventricular myocytes (VMs) and the spatial distribution of bio-pacemakers. A suppressed gap junctional electrical coupling between and heterotypic gap junctions were simulated and a combination of them led to the best performance of the bio-pacemaker. Then, the pacemaking behaviours of three kinds of idealised PM-VM slices were simulated, in which an electrically isolated distribution of bio-pacemaker showed optimal drive capacities. Finally, a real human ventricular slice model was used to verified the conclusions in idealized tissues.

To explain this we developed a model that simulates that a portion of mitochondria that return to the soma are redirected back to the axon rather than being destroyed in somatic lysosomes. Utilizing the developed model, we studied how the percentage of returning mitochondria affects the mean age and age density distributions of mitochondria at different distances from the soma. We also investigated whether turning off the mitochondria anchoring switch can reduce the mean age of mitochondria. For this purpose, we studied the effect of reducing the value of a parameter that characterizes the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary (anchored) state. The reduction of the mean age of mitochondria observed when the chance of mitochondria to get anchored is reduced suggests that some injured neurons may be saved if the percentage of stationary mitochondria is decreased.

Interestingly, they also reported heterogeneity of phenotypic responses with regards to Golgi morphology. Although never systematically investigated, this variability has generally been attributed to poor transfection efficiency or cell cycle specific responses. Here we show that this heterogeneity is the result of differential response to the siRNA knockdown in different Golgi phenotypes, independent of transfection efficiency or cell cycle phases.

However, these approaches do not comprehensively use information about phenotypes of diseases and patients. We present a new method called Phen2Disease that calculates similarity scores between two phenotype sets of patients and diseases by which to prioritize diseases and genes. Specifically, we calculate three scores of information content-based similarities using the phenotypes, and their combination as the respective benchmarks, and integrate them as a final score. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on six real data cohorts with 2051 cases and two simulated data cohorts with 1000 cases.

We have identified a novel neutrophil transcription network induced in response to inflammatory stimuli. We performed the first RNAseq analysis of human neutrophils exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by a meta-analysis of our dataset and previously published studies of LPS-challenged neutrophils. This revealed a robustly enhanced transcriptional network driven by forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors. The network is enriched in genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, including MAFF and ATF3, which are implicated in responses to stress, survival and inflammation. Expression of transcription factors FOXP1 and FOXP4 is induced in neutrophils exposed to inflammatory stimuli, and potential FOXP1/FOXP4 binding sites were identified in several genes in the network, all located in chromatin regions consistent with neutrophil enhancer function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in neutrophils confirmed enhanced binding of FOXP4, but not FOXP1, to multiple sites in response to LPS. Binding to numerous motifs and transactivation of network genes were also observed when FOXP proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. In addition to LPS, the transcriptional network is induced by other inflammatory stimuli, indicating it represents a general neutrophil response to inflammation. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for the FOXP4 transcription network as a regulator of responses to inflammatory stimuli in neutrophils.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.02.518811"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518817", "title": "BBmix: a Bayesian Beta-Binomial mixture model for accurate genotyping from RNA-sequencing", "authors": "Vigorito, E.; Barton, A.; Pitzalis, C.; Lewis, M.

We detected methylation in the chloroplast DNA of the congener Saccharina latissima, a non - model macroalgal species of high ecological (wild populations) and economical (wild and cultured populations) importance in the North Atlantic. To the functional relevance of chloroplast DNA methylation, we compared for the first time methylation patterns between wild and cultured kelp from different climatic regions (High-Arctic (79 {degrees}N) and temperate (53 {degrees}N), laboratory samples at 5 {degrees}C, 10 {degrees}C and 15 {degrees}C). Our results suggest genome -wide differences in methylated sites, and methylation level, between the climatic regions. At gene level, our data found functions related to photosynthesis to be the predominant affected case only for differential methylation between origins, but not between growth conditions. Here, sample origin led to significant differences between cultivated and wild samples due to differential methylation of genes related to DNA replication in the Spitsbergen samples. Both findings indicate that origin and cultivation strongly affected the chloroplast methylome, but differently. Similar methylomes for samples from the same origin -- independent from whether they grow in the wild or in the lab -- suggest that origin- specific methylation marks on the chloroplast genome are inherited. However, the capacity for rapid adaptation (to cultivation conditions) could be shown for Saccharina latissima during this study.

It is mostly caused by pathogenic variants in PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode interacting transmembrane proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2). Among many pathogenic processes described in ADPKD, those associated with cAMP signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming appear to regulate the disease manifestations. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor-2 antagonist that regulates cAMP pathway, is the only FDA-approved ADPKD therapeutic. Tolvaptan reduces renal cyst growth and kidney function loss, but it is not tolerated by many patients and is associated with idiosyncratic liver toxicity. Therefore, additional therapeutic options for ADPKD treatment are needed. As drug repurposing of FDA-approved drug candidates can significantly decrease the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery, we used the computational approach signature reversion to detect inversely related drug response gene expression signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database and identified compounds predicted to reverse disease-associated transcriptomic signatures in three publicly available kidney transcriptomic data sets of mouse ADPKD models. We focused on a pre-cystic model for signature reversion, as it was less impacted by confounding secondary disease mechanisms in ADPKD, and then compared the resulting candidates' target differential expression in the two cystic mouse models. We further prioritized these drug candidates based on their known mechanism of action, FDA status, targets, and by functional enrichment analysis. With this approach, we prioritized 29 unique drug targets differentially expressed in ADPKD cystic models and 16 prioritized drug repurposing candidates that target them, including bromocriptine and mirtazapine.

We report a newly discovered type of GbM in plants, which is under constitutive addition and removal by dynamic methylation modifiers in all cells, including the germline. Methylation at Dynamic GbM genes is removed by the DRDD demethylation pathway, and added by an unknown source of de novo methylation, most likely the maintenance methyltransferase MET1. We show that the Dynamic GbM state is present at homologous genes across divergent lineages (>100 million years), indicating evolutionary conservation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dynamic GbM is tightly associated with the presence of a promoter/regulatory chromatin state within the gene body, in contrast to other gene body methylated genes. Lastly, we find Dynamic GbM is associated with enhanced gene expression plasticity across development and diverse physiological conditions, whereas stably methylated GbM genes exhibit reduced plasticity.

Bioinformatic prediction and mining of CAZymes improves our understanding of these activities, and enables discovery of candidates of interest for industrial biotechnology, particularly the processing of organic waste for biofuel production. CAZy (www.cazy.org) is a high-quality, manually-curated and authoritative database of CAZymes that is often the starting point for these analyses. Automated querying, and integration of CAZy data with other public datasets would constitute a powerful resource for mining and exploring CAZyme diversity. However, CAZy does not itself provide methods to automate queries, or integrate annotation data from other sources (except by following hyperlinks) to support further analysis. To overcome these limitations we developed cazy_webscraper, a command-line tool that retrieves data from CAZy and other online resources to build a local, shareable, and reproducible database that augments and extends the authoritative CAZy database. cazy_webscraper's integration of curated CAZyme annotations with their corresponding protein sequences, up to date taxonomy assignments, and protein structure data facilitates automated large-scale and targeted bioinformatic CAZyme family analysis and candidate screening.

If certain aspects of the substitution process (even when they are not of direct interest) are presumed absent or are modeled with too crude of a simplification, estimates of key model parameters can become biased - often systematically, and lead to poor statistical performance. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of how modeling instantaneous multi-nucleotide (or multi-hit, MH) substitutions impacts dN/dS based inference of episodic diversifying selection at the level of the entire alignment. The inclusion of MH reduces the rate (1.37-fold or 26.8%) at which positive selection is called based on the analysis of N = 9,861 empirical data-sets, while offering significantly better statistical fit to sequence data in 8.37% of cases. Through additional simulation studies, we show that this reduction is not simply due to loss of power because of additional model complexity. After a detailed examination of 21 benchmark alignments and a new high-resolution analysis showing which parts of the alignment provide support for positive selection, we reveal that MH substitutions occurring along shorter branches in the tree are largely responsible for discrepant results in selection detection. Our results add to the growing body of literature which examines decades-old modeling assumptions and finds them to be problematic for biological data analysis. Because multi-nucleotide substitutions have a significant impact on natural selection detection even at the level of an entire gene, we recommend that routine selection analysis of this type consider their inclusion. To facilitate this procedure, we developed a simple model testing selection detection framework able to screen an alignment for positive selection with two biologically important confounding processes: synonymous rate variation, and multi-nucleotide instantaneous substitutions.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.02.518889"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518839", "title": "A thermodynamic description of biomolecular condensates", "authors": "Dubach, M.", "author_corresponding": "Matt Dubach", "author_corresponding_institution": "MGH", "date": "2022-12-03", "category": "biophysics", "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are intracellular membrane-less accumulations of proteins and other molecules at a higher concentration than the rest of the cell.

Yet, the physics of condensate formation remains unsolved. Here, it is shown that intrinsically disordered protein-protein binding alone provides energetically favorable thermodynamics for condensate formation. The reduction in free energy achieved through increased binding at high condensate concentrations can overcome the entropic cost of de-mixing. Formation of condensates is governed by the ratio of total protein concentration to binding affinity ([protein]total/Kd).
