Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs). Glutamylation is one of them, and it is responsible for adding one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both - and {beta}-tubulin. However, very little is known about the specific modifications found on the different tubulin isotypes in vivo and the role of these PTMs in MT transport and other cellular processes in vivo. In this study, we found that in Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of -tubulin isotypes occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of Tub84B and Tub84D (Tub84B/D). In contrast, the ovarian -tubulin, Tub67C, is not glutamylated. The C-terminal ends of Tub84B/D are glutamylated at several glutamyl side chains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian Tub84B/D and with this for the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules. Similarly, proper kinesin distribution in the germline also depends on TTLL5 as well as the refining of Staufen localization and the normal fast ooplasmic streaming with its directional movement, two processes known to depend on kinesin activities. In the nervous system, the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria is affected by an enzymatically dead mutant of TTLL5.

A model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca2+-independent binding. Although structures support a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from calmodulin-disrupted SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca2+, and C-lobe binding affinity is strong independent of Ca2+. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca2+ binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca2+ concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca2+. Our peptide binding data and electrophysiology show that SK gating models need deeper scrutiny.

Here, we investigate the molecular basis for this transduction mechanism by studying the mechanosensitive ion channel MscS from Escherichia coli and its eukaryotic homolog, MSL1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. First, we use single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structure of a novel open conformation of wild-type MscS, stabilized in a thinned lipid nanodisc. Compared with the closed state, the structure shows a reconfiguration of helices TM1, TM2 and TM3a, and widening of the central pore. Based on these structures, we examined how the morphology of the lipid bilayer is altered upon gating, using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal that closed-state MscS causes drastic protrusions in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, both in the absence and presence of lateral tension, and for different lipid compositions. These deformations arise to provide adequate solvation to hydrophobic features of the protein surface in this conformation, and clearly reflect a high energy conformation for the membrane, particularly under tension. Strikingly, these protrusions are largely eradicated upon channel opening. An analogous computational study of open and closed MSL1 recapitulates these findings. The gating equilibrium of MscS channels thus appears to be dictated by two opposing conformational preferences, namely those of the lipid membrane and of the protein structure. We propose a membrane deformation model of mechanosensation, which posits that tension shifts the gating equilibrium towards the conductive state not because it alters the mode in which channel and lipids interact but because it increases the energetic cost of the morphological perturbations in the membrane induced by to the closed state.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.07.01.498513"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.07.06.498924", "title": "CryoEM Structures of the Human HIV-1 Restriction Factor SERINC3 and Function as a Lipid Transporter", "authors": "Leonhardt, S.

In this study, the microbial community of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere was spiked with technical cashew nut shell liquid, and after incubation, the eDNA was extracted and subsequently used to build a metagenomic library. We report the biochemical features and crystal structure of a novel esterase from the family IV, EH0, retrieved from an uncultured sphingomonad after a functional screen in tributyrin agar plates. EH0 (Topt, 50 {degrees}C; Tm, 55.7 {degrees}C; pHopt, 9.5) was stable in the presence of 10-20% v/v organic solvents and exhibited hydrolytic activity against p-nitrophenyl esters from acetate to palmitate, preferably butyrate (496 U mg-1), and a large battery of 69 structurally different esters (up to 30.2 U mg-1), including bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (0.16 {+/-} 0.06 U mg-1). This broad substrate specificity contrasts with the fact that EH0 showed a long and narrow catalytic tunnel, whose access appears to be hindered by a thigth folding of its cap domain. We propose that this cap domain is a highly flexible structure whose opening is mediated by unique structural elements, one of which is the presence of two contiguous proline residues likely acting as possible hinges, that altogether allow for the entrance of the substrates. Therefore, this work provides a new role for the cap domain, which until now was thought to be immobile elements that contain hydrophobic patches involved in substrate pre-recognition and in turn substrate specificity within family IV esterases.\n\nIMPORTANCEA better understanding of structure-function relationships of enzymes allows revealing key structural motifs or elements. Here, we studied the structural basis of the substrate promiscuity of EH0, a family IV esterase, isolated from a sample of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere microbiome exposed to technical cashew nut shell liquid. The analysis of EH0 revealed the potential of the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome as a source of enzymes with interesting properties, such as pH and solvent tolerance and remarkably broad substrate promiscuity. Its structure resembled those of homologous proteins from mesophilic Parvibaculum and Erythrobacter spp. and hyperthermophilic Pyrobaculum and Sulfolobus spp. and had a very narrow, single-entry access tunnel to the active site, access which is controlled by a capping domain that includes a number of not conserved proline residues. These structural markers, distinct from those of other substrate promiscuous esterases, can help tuning substrate profiles beyond tunnel and active site engineering.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.09.10.507389"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.13.507733", "title": "The Aphelenchoides genomes reveal substantial horizontal gene transfers in the last common ancestor of free-living and major plant parasitic nematodes", "authors": "Lai, C.-K.; Lee, Y.; Ke, H.-M.; Lu, M.

Protein import is critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic function and health; loss of function has been implicated with a wide range of pathologies. Despite this, our understanding of the kinetic and dynamics of import is somewhat limited, particularly within mammalian cells. Here, we report an adaptation of an assay system, established previously to monitor mitochondrial import into isolated yeast mitochondria, to quantitatively monitor mitochondrial import inside mammalian cells. The reporting is based on a split luciferase, whereby the large fragment is segregated in the mitochondrial matrix and the small complementary fragment is fused to the C-terminus of a recombinant precursor protein destined for import. Following import successively through the TOM complex of the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex of the inner membrane, the complementary fragments combine to form an active luciferase. The resultant luminescent signal provides a sensitive, accurate, free of noise and continuous measure of protein import, enabling mathematical model fitting to identify and understand the steps that make up import. This advance allows detailed mechanistic examination of the transport process in live cells. In addition, the assay will enable characterisation of the protein import when the machinery is challenged; for example, in situations associated with disease. Moreover, the assay is compatible with high throughput for large data set collection and kinetic modelling, as well as for drug screening and characterisation.

Here, we use the recently introduced q-canonical ensemble, which allows us to decouple measurements of charge state and conformation, to explain the observed insensitivity of SAH helicity to pH. We couple the outputs from separate measurements of charge and conformation with atomistic simulations to derive residue-specific quantifications of preferences for being in an alpha helix and for the ionizable residues to be charged vs. uncharged. We find a clear preference for accommodating uncharged Glu residues within internal positions of SAH-forming sequences. The stabilities of alpha helical conformations increase with the number of E4K4 repeats and so do the numbers of accessible charge states that are compatible with forming conformations of high helical content. There is conformational buffering whereby charge state heterogeneity buffers against large-scale conformational changes thus making the overall helicity insensitive to large changes in pH.

Yet, the genotype-phenotype relationships underlying developmental system variation are understudied due to their inherent complexity. Taking advantage of the simple Caenorhabditis elegans germline stem cell system, we characterized natural differences in the germ stem cell niche activity of two distinct wild isolates--measured as differences in germline progenitor zone (PZ) size. Through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we detected multiple candidate causal loci, including two large-effect QTL on chromosomes II and V. Resolving the chromosome V QTL, we show that the isolate with a smaller PZ exhibits a unique 148 bp deletion in the promoter region of the Notch ligand, lag-2, a central signal promoting germ stem cell fate and proliferation. As predicted, introducing this deletion into the isolate with a large PZ resulted in a smaller PZ. Unexpectedly, re-introducing the deleted ancestral sequence in the isolate with a smaller PZ further reduced PZ size. Using allelic replacement lines, we show that these contradictory phenotypic effects are due to epistatic interactions among the lag-2 promoter, the chromosome II QTL, and additional loci in the genome. Although the lag-2 deletion appeared to explain natural variation in germ stem cell niche activity, its effects across multiple genetic backgrounds were unpredictable due to higher-order epistasis.

This well-established phenomenon suggests that proton trapping on the membrane interface ensures vectorial lateral transport of protons from proton pumps to ATP synthases (proton acceptors). Despite the key role of the proton transport in bioenergetics, the molecular mechanism of proton transfer in the OXPHOS system is not yet completely established. Here, we developed a dynamics model of long-range transport of energized protons along the MIM accompanied by collective excitation of localized wave proragating on the membrane surface. Our model is based on the new data on the macromolecular organization of OXPHOS showing the well-ordered structure of respirasomes and ATP synthases on the cristae membrane folds. We developed a two-component dynamics model of the proton transport considering two coupled subsystems: the ordered hydrogen bond (HB) chain of water molecules and lipid headgroups of MIM. We analytically obtained two-component soliton solution in this model, which describes the motion of the proton kink, corresponding to successive proton hops in the HB chain, and coherent motion of a compression soliton in the chain of lipid headgroups. The local deformation in a soliton range facilitates proton jumps due to water molecules approaching each other in the HB chain. We suggested that the proton-conducting structures formed along the cristae membrane surface promote direct lateral proton transfer in the OXPHOS system.

Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required.

We present the first comprehensive study of histone-lysine and DNA methyltransferases across the Mucoromycota, emphasizing heterochromatin formation pathways that rely on the Clr4 complex involved in H3K9-methylation, the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 driving H3K27-methylation, or DNMT1-like methyl-transferases that catalyze 5mC DNA methylation. Our analysis uncovered H3K9-methylated heterochromatin as the major chromatin modification repressing transcription in these fungi, which lack both Polycomb silencing and cytosine methylation. Although small RNAs generated by RNAi pathways facilitate the formation of heterochromatin in many eukaryotic organisms, we show that RNAi is not required to maintain either genomic or centromeric heterochromatin in Mucor. H3K9-methylation and RNAi act independently to control centromeric regions, suggesting a functional sub-specialization. Whereas the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and heterochromatin formation are essential for cell viability, RNAi is dispensable for viability yet acts as the main epigenetic, regulatory force repressing transposition of centromeric GremLINE1 elements. Mutations inactivating canonical RNAi lead to rampant transposition and insertional inactivation of targets resulting in antimicrobial drug resistance. This fine-tuned, Rdrp2-dependent RNAi activity is critical for genome stability, restricting GremLINE1 retroelements to the centromeres where they occupy long heterochromatic islands. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi and heterochromatin formation are independent genome defense and regulatory mechanisms in the Mucorales, contributing to a paradigm shift from the co-transcriptional gene silencing observed in fission yeasts to models in which heterochromatin and RNAi operate independently in early-diverging fungi.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.01.518749"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518810", "title": "Biomechanical characterisation of thoracic ascending aorta with preserved pre-stresses", "authors": "Parikh, S.; Moerman, K.

Aortic geometries obtained from routine medical imaging do not display wall stress distribution and mechanical properties. Mechanical properties for a given vessel may be determined from medical images at different physiological pressures using inverse finite element analysis. However, without considering pre-stresses, the estimation of mechanical properties will lack accuracy. In the present paper, we propose and evaluate a mechanical parameter identification technique, which recovers pre-stresses by determining the zero-pressure configuration of the aortic geometry. We first validated the method on a cylindrical geometry and subsequently applied it to a realistic aortic geometry. Verification of the assessed parameters was performed using synthetically generated reference data for both geometries.

However, diameter sizes solely are not indicative of the degenerative changes in the vessel wall. Patient-specific tissue mechanical properties give better insight into the degenerative changes caused due to the variations in mass densities of the vessel wall constituents. Inverse finite element analysis can be performed on aortic geometries derived from medical images to determine tissue mechanical properties. Performing inverse finite element analysis on geometries obtained directly from medical images leads to incorrect estimation of vessel wall stresses and therefore, mechanical properties. Mechanical properties estimation is incorrect because inverse analysis does not take into account the pre-stressed nature of the geometry.

However, these probes only poorly reproduce the complexity of the native cellular microenvironment and consequently of the biological interactions.\n\nWe developed a novel approach to produce AFM probes that faithfully reproduce the structural and biochemical complexity of the ECM; this was achieved by attaching to an AFM cantilever a micrometric slice of native decellularised ECM cut by laser microdissection, and preserving the full morphological, mechanical, and chemical heterogeneity of the ECM.\n\nThese native ECM probes can be used in force spectroscopy experiments aimed at targeting cell-microenvironment interactions.

This study aimed to elucidate the underlying factors that affect bio-pacemakers performance and to discover possible optimising solutions to enable the potential use of bio-pacemaker therapy.\n\nMethods and resultsThe human ventricular myocytes model in this study followed the ten Tussuchers model in 2006, and the bio-pacemaker single cell model was modified based on it as what has been expatiated in our previous work. In tissue model, two factors were primarily evaluated for their effects on bio-pacemakers to pace and drive surrounding cardiac tissue: gap junction between bio-pacemaker cells (PMs) and adjacent ventricular myocytes (VMs) and the spatial distribution of bio-pacemakers. A suppressed gap junctional electrical coupling between and heterotypic gap junctions were simulated and a combination of them led to the best performance of the bio-pacemaker. Then, the pacemaking behaviours of three kinds of idealised PM-VM slices were simulated, in which an electrically isolated distribution of bio-pacemaker showed optimal drive capacities. Finally, a real human ventricular slice model was used to verified the conclusions in idealized tissues.\n\nConclusionThis study develops a theory that weak-rectified electrical coupling and electrically isolated distribution can enhance the pacemaking efficiency of bio-pacemakers, which lays the groundwork for future research into therapeutic applications of bio-pacemakers.\n\nAuthor summaryBiologically engineered pacemakers are expected to be a substitute for electronic pacemakers because of their physiological superiority, but how to transform them for practical application remains challenging.

To explain this, we developed a model that simulates mitochondria distribution when a portion of mitochondria that return to the soma are redirected back to the axon rather than being destroyed in somatic lysosomes.\n\nUtilizing the developed model, we studied how the percentage of returning mitochondria affects the mean age and age density distributions of mitochondria at different distances from the soma. We also investigated whether turning off the mitochondria anchoring switch can reduce the mean age of mitochondria. For this purpose, we studied the effect of reducing the value of a parameter that characterizes the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary (anchored) state. The reduction in mitochondria mean age observed when the anchoring probability is reduced suggests that some injured neurons may be saved if the percentage of stationary mitochondria is decreased. The replacement of possibly damaged stationary mitochondria with newly synthesized ones may restore the energy supply in an injured axon.

Interestingly, they also reported heterogeneity of phenotypic responses with regards to Golgi morphology. Although never systematically investigated, this variability has generally been attributed to poor transfection efficiency or cell cycle specific responses. Here we show that this heterogeneity is the result of differential response to the siRNA knockdown in different Golgi phenotypes, independent of transfection efficiency or cell cycle phases.

We have identified a novel neutrophil transcription network induced in response to inflammatory stimuli. We performed the first RNAseq analysis of human neutrophils exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by a meta-analysis of our dataset and previously published studies of LPS-challenged neutrophils. This revealed a robustly enhanced transcriptional network driven by forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors. The network is enriched in genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, including MAFF and ATF3, which are implicated in responses to stress, survival and inflammation. Expression of transcription factors FOXP1 and FOXP4 is induced in neutrophils exposed to inflammatory stimuli, and potential FOXP1/FOXP4 binding sites were identified in several genes in the network, all located in chromatin regions consistent with neutrophil enhancer function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in neutrophils confirmed enhanced binding of FOXP4, but not FOXP1, to multiple sites in response to LPS. Binding to numerous motifs and transactivation of network genes were also observed when FOXP proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. In addition to LPS, the transcriptional network is induced by other inflammatory stimuli, indicating it represents a general neutrophil response to inflammation. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for the FOXP4 transcription network as a regulator of responses to inflammatory stimuli in neutrophils.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn response to pathogens, neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells in the body, are the first to be recruited to sites of infection. However, defects in neutrophil responses lead to common chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive lung disease and autoimmune disorders. As such, it is critical to uncover the molecular players implicated in neutrophil responses to signals that induce inflammation. Here we profile how bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is derived from the cell walls of bacteria and is a commonly used agent to mimic inflammation, alters gene transcription in isolated human neutrophils. We also combined our data with those of other published studies to identify conserved molecular pathways stimulated in LPS-exposed neutrophils. This analysis revealed a network of genes whose transcription is regulated by members of the so-called forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors. We provide evidence that FOXP4 regulates transcription of genes within the network in neutrophils. We also find that the same network of genes is induced by other inflammatory stimuli, suggesting it plays a role in neutrophil responses to inflammation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.02.518811"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518817", "title": "BBmix: a Bayesian Beta-Binomial mixture model for accurate genotyping from RNA-sequencing", "authors": "Vigorito, E.; Barton, A.; Pitzalis, C.; Lewis, M.

Both findings indicate that origin and cultivation strongly affected the chloroplast methylome, but differently. Similar methylomes for samples from the same origin - independent from whether they grow in the wild or in the lab - suggest that origin-specific methylation marks on the chloroplast genome are inherited.

It is mostly caused by pathogenic variants in PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode interacting transmembrane proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2). Among many pathogenic processes described in ADPKD, those associated with cAMP signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming appear to regulate the disease manifestations. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor-2 antagonist that regulates cAMP pathway, is the only FDA-approved ADPKD therapeutic. Tolvaptan reduces renal cyst growth and kidney function loss, but it is not tolerated by many patients and is associated with idiosyncratic liver toxicity. Therefore, additional therapeutic options for ADPKD treatment are needed. As drug repurposing of FDA-approved drug candidates can significantly decrease the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery, we used the computational approach signature reversion to detect inversely related drug response gene expression signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database and identified compounds predicted to reverse disease-associated transcriptomic signatures in three publicly available kidney transcriptomic data sets of mouse ADPKD models. We focused on a pre-cystic model for signature reversion, as it was less impacted by confounding secondary disease mechanisms in ADPKD, and then compared the resulting candidates target differential expression in the two cystic mouse models. We further prioritized these drug candidates based on their known mechanism of action, FDA status, targets, and by functional enrichment analysis. With this approach, we prioritized 29 unique drug targets differentially expressed in ADPKD cystic models and 16 prioritized drug repurposing candidates that target them, including bromocriptine and mirtazapine.

Whereas the role of DNA methylation on the silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA is well understood, gene body methylation is not associated with transcriptional repression, and its biological importance has remained unclear.\n\nResultsWe report a newly discovered type of GbM in plants, which is under constitutive addition and removal by dynamic methylation modifiers in all cells, including the germline. Methylation at Dynamic GbM genes is removed by the DRDD demethylation pathway, and added by an unknown source of de novo methylation, most likely the maintenance methyltransferase MET1. We show that the Dynamic GbM state is present at homologous genes across divergent lineages (>100 million years), indicating evolutionary conservation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dynamic GbM is tightly associated with the presence of a promoter/regulatory chromatin state within the gene body, in contrast to other gene body methylated genes. Lastly, we find Dynamic GbM is associated with enhanced gene expression plasticity across development and diverse physiological conditions, whereas stably methylated GbM genes exhibit reduced plasticity.\n\nConclusionsThis study proposes a new model for GbM in regulating gene expression plasticity, including a newly discovered type of GbM in which increased gene expression plasticity is associated with the activity of DNA methylation writers and erasers and the enrichment of a regulatory chromatin state. We propose that Dynamic GbM is a hallmark of genes that can navigate a greater landscape of transcriptional states by maintaining regulatory flexibility.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.02.518885"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518825", "title": "cazy_webscraper: local compilation and interrogation of comprehensive CAZyme datasets", "authors": "Hobbs, E.

If certain aspects of the substitution process (even when they are not of direct interest) are presumed absent or are modeled with too crude of a simplification, estimates of key model parameters can become biased - often systematically, and lead to poor statistical performance. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of how modeling instantaneous multi-nucleotide (or multi-hit, MH) substitutions impacts dN/dS based inference of episodic diversifying selection at the level of the entire alignment. The inclusion of MH reduces the rate (1.37-fold or 26.8%) at which positive selection is called based on the analysis of N = 9,861 empirical data-sets, while offering significantly better statistical fit to sequence data in 8.37% of cases. Through additional simulation studies, we show that this reduction is not simply due to loss of power because of additional model complexity. After a detailed examination of 21 benchmark alignments and a new high-resolution analysis showing which parts of the alignment provide support for positive selection, we reveal that MH substitutions occurring along shorter branches in the tree are largely responsible for discrepant results in selection detection. Our results add to the growing body of literature which examines decades-old modeling assumptions and finds them to be problematic for biological data analysis. Because multi-nucleotide substitutions have a significant impact on natural selection detection even at the level of an entire gene, we recommend that routine selection analysis of this type consider their inclusion.

Whilst genetic assessment of the H5N8 HPAIVs within the UK demonstrated relative homogeneity, there was a background of other genotypes circulating at a lower degree with different neuraminidase and internal genes. Following a small number of summer detections of H5N1 in wild birds over the summer of 2021, autumn/winter 2021/22 saw another European H5 HPAIV epizootic, that has dwarfed the prior epizootic. This second epizootic was dominated almost exclusively by H5N1 HPAIV, although six distinct genotypes were defined.

In this study, we present matched transcriptional (scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution of two treatment naive MBC tumors processed immediately after surgical resection.

Despite this diversity, a key feature that unites paramyxoviruses is the presence of a receptor-binding protein, RBP, which facilitates host-cell attachment and plays a fundamental role in determining host-range. Here, we study the RBP presented on the surface of rodent-borne paramyxoviruses Mossman and Nariva (MosV and NarV, respectively), viruses that constitute founding members of the recently defined Narmovirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. Crystallographic analysis of the C-terminal head region of the dimeric MosV and NarV RBPs demonstrates that while these glycoproteins retain the canonical six-bladed {beta}-propeller fold found in other paramyxoviral RBPs, they lack the structural motifs associated with established paramyxovirus host-cell receptor entry pathways. Consistent with MosV-RBP and NarV-RBP undergoing a distinct entry pathway from other characterized paramyxoviruses, structure-based phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that these six-bladed {beta}-propeller head domains form a singular structural class that is distinct from other paramyxoviral RBPs. Additionally, using an integrated crystallographic and small angle X-ray scattering analysis, we confirm that MosV-RBP and NarV-RBP form homodimeric arrangements that are distinct from those adopted by other paramyxovirus RBPs. Altogether, this investigation provides a molecular-level blueprint of the narmovirus RBP that broadens our understanding of the structural space and functional diversity available to paramyxovirus RBPs.\n\nImportanceGenetically diverse paramyxoviruses are united in their presentation of a receptor-binding protein (RBP), which works in concert with the fusion protein to facilitate host-cell entry.

Here, we reveal the architecture of the C-terminal head region of the RBPs from Nariva virus (NarV) and Mossman virus (MosV), two archetypal rodent-borne paramyxoviruses within the recently established genus Narmovirus, family Paramyxoviridae. Our analysis reveals that while narmoviruses retain the general architectural features associated with paramyxoviral RBPs, namely a six-bladed {beta}-propeller fold, they lack the structural motifs associated with known receptor-mediated host-cell entry pathways. This investigation indicates that the RBPs of narmoviruses exhibit pathobiological features that are distinct from those of other paramyxoviruses.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/03/2022.12.02.518945"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518936", "title": "Cell-Sized Lipid Vesicles as Artificial Antigen-Presenting Cells for Antigen-Specific T Cell Activation", "authors": "Chen, J.-Y.; Agrawal, S.; Yi, H.-P.; Vallejo, D.; Agrawal, A.; Lee, A.", "author_corresponding": "Abraham Lee", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of California, Irvine", "date": "2022-12-03", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "In this study, efficient T cell activation is demonstrated using cell-sized artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) with protein-conjugated bilayer lipid membranes that mimic biological cell membranes.

Previous studies suggest significant differences in the transport mechanisms of type I vs. type II bacterial ABC importers, which contain unrelated transmembrane domains. We herein use ensemble fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments to characterize the kinetics of SBP interaction in the E. coli BtuCD-F complex, a canonical type II ABC importer that transports vitamin B12. We demonstrate that, in the absence of B12, BtuF (the SBP) forms a  locked (kinetically hyper-stable) complex with nanodisc-reconstituted BtuCD that can only be dissociated by ATP hydrolysis, which represents a futile reaction cycle. Notably, no type I importer has been observed to form an equivalent locked complex. We also show that either ATP or vitamin B12 binding substantially slows formation of the locked BtuCD-F complex, which will limit the occurrence of futile hydrolysis under physiological conditions.\n\nMutagenesis experiments demonstrate that efficient locking requires concerted interaction of BtuCD with residues on both sides of the B12 binding pocket in BtuF. Combined with the kinetic inhibition of locking by ATP binding, these observations imply that the transition state for the locking reaction involves a global alteration in the conformation of BtuCD that extends from its BtuF binding site in the periplasm to its ATP-binding sites on the opposite side of the membrane in the cytoplasm.

Here, we report development of an smFRET system that exploits fluorescence quenching by vitamin B12 to track its location in real time during ATP-driven transport by nanodisc-reconstituted E. coli BtuCD-F, an extensively studied type II ABC importer. Our data demonstrate that transmembrane translocation of B12 is driven by two sequential high-energy conformational changes that are inaccessible to standard structural methods because they are inherently transient. The first moves B12 from the periplasm into the transmembrane domain of the transporter; notably, this reaction is driven by hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule, in contrast to the mechanism established for several other ABC Transporter families in which ATP-binding drives the mechanochemical power-stroke prior to hydrolysis. The second mediates B12 release on the opposite side of the transporter, and it is driven by formation of a hyper-stable complex between BtuCD and BtuF. Hydrolysis of a second single ATP molecule is then required to dissociate BtuCD from the BtuF substrate-binding protein to enable it to bind B12 and initiate another round of transport.

The model results suggest the proper mode of interaction between the gliding motors and reversal regulators that can generate the observed increase of cell reversal frequency on stiffer substrates.

Using this tool, we analyzed two human samples (NA18943 and NA19240) sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore sequencer.

However, an understanding of how Cas9 and DNA deaminases collaborate to shape base editor (BE) outcomes has been lacking. Here, we employ a range of hyperactive AID base editors (hBEs) to deduce a novel mechanistic model that reveals multiple layers of previously underappreciated cooperativity in BE steps. These include: (1) Cas9 binding can potentially expose both DNA strands for  capture by the deaminase, a feature enhanced by guide mismatches; (2) after strand capture, intrinsic deaminase activity can tune window size and base editing activity; and (3) non-canonical base edits can be further elicited by modulating Cas9 nicking activity.

It is found in both plants and animals, but is directly and stably (epigenetically) inherited over multiple generations in the former. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated that plants originating from different parts of the world exhibit large differences in gbM, which presumably reflects an epigenetic memory of ancestral genetic and/or environmental factors.\n\nHere we look for evidence of such factors in F2 plants resulting from a cross between a southern Swedish line with low gbM and a northern Swedish line with high gbM, grown at two different temperatures. Using bisulfite-sequencing data with nucleotide-level resolution on hundreds of individuals, we confirm that CG sites are either methylated (nearly 100% methylation across sampled cells) or unmethylated (approximately 0% methylation across sampled cells), and show that the higher level of gbM in the northern line is due to more sites being methylated. Furthermore, methylation variants almost always show Mendelian segregation, consistent with their being directly and stably inherited through meiosis.\n\nTo explore how the differences between the parental lines could have arisen, we focused on somatic deviations from the inherited state, distinguishing between gains (relative to the inherited 0% methylation) and losses (relative to the inherited 100% methylation) at each site in the F2 generation. We demonstrate that deviations predominantly affect sites that differ between the parental lines, consistent with these sites being more mutable. Gains and losses behave very differently in terms of the genomic distribution, and are influenced by the local chromatin state. We find clear evidence for different trans-acting genetic polymorphism affecting both gains and losses, with those affecting gains showing strong environmental interactions (GxE). Direct effects of the environment were minimal.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that genetic and environmental factors can change gbM at a cellular level, and hypothesize that these factors can also lead to trans-generational differences between individuals via the inclusion of such changes in the zygote.\n\nAuthor summaryGene-body methylation, the sparse CG methylation of house-keeping genes, is found in both plants and animals, but can be directly inherited in the former.

Uso1/p115 contains a globular-head-domain (GHD), a coiled-coil (CC) mediating dimerization/tethering and a C-terminal region (CTR) interacting with golgins. Uso1/p115 is recruited to vesicles by RAB1. Paradoxically, genetic studies placed Uso1 acting upstream of, or in conjunction with RAB1 (Sapperstein et al., 1996). We selected two missense mutations in uso1 resulting in E6K and G540S substitutions in the GHD permitting growth of otherwise inviable rab1-deficient Aspergillus nidulans. Remarkably, the double mutant suppresses the complete absence of RAB1. Full-length Uso1 and CTR{Delta} proteins are dimeric and the GHD lacking the CC/CTR is monomeric irrespective of whether they carry or not E6K/G540S. Microscopy showed recurrence of Uso1 on puncta (60 sec half-life) colocalizing with RAB1 and less so with early Golgi markers Sed5 and GeaA/Gea1/Gea2. Localization of Uso1 but not of Uso1E6K/G540S to puncta is abolished by compromising RAB1 function, indicating that E6K/G540S creates interactions bypassing RAB1. By S-tag-coprecipitation we demonstrate that Uso1 is an associate of the Sed5/Bos1/Bet1/Sec22 SNARE complex zippering vesicles with the Golgi, with Uso1E6K/G540S showing stronger association. Bos1 and Bet1 bind the Uso1 GHD directly, but Bet1 is a strong E6K/G540S-independent binder, whereas Bos1 is weaker but becomes as strong as Bet1 when the GHD carries E6K/G540S. AlphaFold2 predicts that G540S actually increases binding of GHD to the Bos1 Habc domain. In contrast, E6K seemingly increases membrane targeting of an N-terminal amphipathic -helix, explaining phenotypic additivity. Overexpression of E6K/G540S and wild-type GHD complemented uso1{Delta}. Thus, a GHD monomer provides the essential Uso1 functions, demonstrating that long-range tethering activity is dispensable. Therefore, when enhanced by E6K/G540S, Uso1 binding to Bos1/Bet1 required to regulate SNAREs bypasses both the contribution of RAB1 to Uso1 recruitment and the reported role of RAB1 in SNARE complex formation (Lupashin and Waters, 1997), suggesting that the latter is consequence of the former.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/06/2022.11.30.518472"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518887", "title": "GEMC1 and MCIDAS interactions with SWI/SNF complexes regulate the multiciliated cell-specific transcriptional program", "authors": "Lewis, M.; Terre, B.; Knobel, P.

In contrast to mammalian hexokinases, the yeast Hxk2 enzyme has been proposed to shuttle into the nucleus in glucose replete conditions where it reportedly moonlights as part of a glucose-repressive transcriptional complex. To achieve this role in glucose repression, Hxk2 reportedly binds the Mig1 transcriptional repressor, is dephosphorylated at serine 15 in its N-terminus, and requires an N-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS).\n\nIn this study, we use high-resolution, quantitative, fluorescent microscopy of live cells to determine the conditions, residues, and regulatory proteins required for Hxk2 nuclear localization. In direct contradiction to previous yeast studies, our quantitative imaging demonstrates that Hxk2 is largely excluded from the nucleus under glucose replete conditions but is retained in the nucleus under glucose limiting conditions. Our data show that the Hxk2 N-terminus does not contain an NLS but instead comprises sequences necessary for nuclear exclusion and multimerization regulation. Amino acid substitutions of the phosphorylated residue, serine 15, disrupt Hxk2 dimerization but have no effect on its glucose-regulated nuclear localization. Substitution of alanine at the nearby residue, lysine 13, affects both dimerization and maintenance of nuclear exclusion under glucose replete conditions. Modeling and simulation provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. In marked contrast to earlier studies, we find that the transcriptional repressor Mig1 and the protein kinase Snf1 have little effect on Hxk2 localization. Instead, the protein kinase Tda1 is a key regulator of Hxk2 localization.\n\nFinally, RNAseq analyses of the yeast transcriptome further dispel the idea that Hxk2 moonlights as a transcriptional repressor, demonstrating that Hxk2 has a negligible role in transcriptional regulation in both glucose replete and limiting conditions. Taken together, our studies provide a paradigm shift for the conditions, residues, and regulators controlling Hxk2 dimerization and nuclear localization. Based on our data, the nuclear translocation of Hxk2 in yeast occurs in glucose starvation conditions, a finding that aligns well with the nuclear regulation of mammalian orthologs of this enzyme. Our findings lay the foundation for future studies of Hxk2 nuclear activity.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/05/2022.11.30.518474"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.04.519044", "title": "Endometrial adhesion G protein-coupled receptors are dynamically expressed across the menstrual cycle and expression is altered by ovarian stimulation", "authors": "Kalakota, N.

To improve pregnancy rates and reduce the risk of pregnancy complications associated with IVF, it is crucial to advance our molecular understanding of the molecular regulation of endometrial differentiation. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important regulators of endometrial differentiation. To investigate this further, using a retrospective dataset, we identified all GPCRs expressed across the proliferative and secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and found that many members of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (ADGR) family are dynamically expressed. For each ADGR subfamily exhibiting differentially-expressed genes across the cycle, their expression was investigated by RT-PCR in the non-pregnant mouse uterus and decidua on E7.5 of pregnancy. For those genes expressed in the E7.5 decidua, their expression was further quantified by qPCR across early mouse pregnancy. The RT-PCR screen revealed expression of 13 ADGRs (4 of the 9 subfamilies) in E7.5 decidua and among these genes, many were differentially expressed between E0.5 and E5.5 or 6.5 and between E5.5 and E6.5. The dynamic expression of the ADGRs across the menstrual cycle and in early mouse pregnancy, suggests these ADGRs are E2- and/or P4-regulated genes. We therefore hypothesized that for these ADGR genes, mRNA expression would be disrupted in an OS cycle. This hypothesis was tested on endometrial biopsies collected in the secretory phase from prospective cohorts of women in natural and OS cycles. Consistent with the retrospective dataset, our data revealed that members of the ADGR gene family are expressed in the secretory phase of the natural menstrual cycle and for the first time, we show that their expression is altered by ovarian stimulation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.12.04.519044"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.29.518289", "title": "Invasive terrestrial invertebrate detection in water and soil using a targeted eDNA approach", "authors": "Villacorta-Rath, C.; Lach, L.; Andrade-Rodriguez, N.; Burrows, D.; Gleeson, D.; Trujillo-Gonzalez, A.", "author_corresponding": "Cecilia Villacorta-Rath", "author_corresponding_institution": "James Cook University", "date": "2022-12-05", "category": "genetics", "abstract": "O_LITerrestrial invasive invertebrates can rapidly colonize new areas, causing detrimental effects on biodiversity, economy, and lifestyle.

Comparison of sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms between the closely related nematode species C. briggsae (Cbr) and C. elegans (Cel) revealed that the genetic regulatory hierarchy controlling these processes is conserved, but both the X-chromosome target specificity and mode of binding for the specialized condensin dosage compensation complex (DCC) controlling X gene expression have diverged. We identified two motifs within Cbr DCC recruitment sites that are highly enriched on X: 13-bp MEX and 30-bp MEX II. Mutating either MEX or MEX II in an endogenous recruitment site with multiple copies of one or both motifs reduced binding, but only removing all motifs eliminated binding in vivo. Hence, DCC binding to Cbr recruitment sites appears additive. In contrast, DCC binding to Cel recruitment sites is synergistic: mutating even one motif in vivo eliminated binding. Although all X-chromosome motifs share the sequence CAGGG, they have otherwise diverged so that a motif from one species cannot function in the other. This functional divergence was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. A single nucleotide position in Cbr MEX can act as a critical determinant for whether Cel DCC binds. The rapid divergence of DCC target specificity could have contributed to nematode speciation and contrasts dramatically with the conservation of target specificity for transcription factors that control developmental processes such as body-plan specification from fruit flies to mice.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.12.05.519163"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.05.519186", "title": "Characterization of a strain-specific CD-1 reference genome reveals potential inter- and intra-strain functional variability", "authors": "Jung, Y.

Knowledge of the full genetic variability of CD-1 would make it more useful in toxicology, pharmacology, and fundamental biomedical research.\n\nResultsWe performed deep genomic DNA sequencing of CD-1 mice and used the data to identify genome-wide SNPs, indels, and germline transposable elements relative to the mm10 reference genome.

In particular, the microvascular network of the vasa vasorum provides the primary blood supply to the outer aortic wall and is a key component of inter-layer vascular health.

To address this unmet need we aimed to generate inducible NHP models of photoreceptor degeneration. We generated three cynomolgus macaque models using distinct strategies. We used two genetically targeted strategies using optogenetics and Crispr-Cas9 to ablate specifically rods to mimic rod-cone dystrophy.

In the acute model, the degeneration was faster and involved both rods and cones. Among the three distinct NHP models, the Crispr-Cas9 based approach was the most advantageous model in view of recapitulating disease specific features and its ease of implementation.

The behavioural system design is guided by the Behavioural Change Wheel and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation behavioural model. The system exploits the ever-increasing availability of health data from wearable devices, point-of-care tests and consumer genetic tests to issue highly personalised physical activity and sedentary behaviour recommendations. To provide the personalised recommendations, the system firstly classifies the user into one of four diabetes clusters based on their cardiometabolic profile. Secondly, it recommends activity levels based on their genotype and past activity history, and finally, it presents the user with their current risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In addition, leptin, a hormone involved in metabolism, is included as a feedback biosignal to personalise the recommendations further. As a case study, we designed and demonstrated the system on people with type 2 diabetes, since it is a chronic condition often managed through lifestyle changes, such as physical activity increase and sedentary behaviour reduction. We trained and simulated the system using data from diabetic participants of the UK Biobank, a large-scale clinical database, and demonstrate that the system could help increase activity over time.

From the transcriptome data of R. viridis, we identified the gene RvNaRL, which had sequence similarity to nitrate reductases found in plants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RvNaRL was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event. To verify its function of the protein product RvNaRL, we established a RNAi mediated knockdown and a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout experiments for the first time in R. viridis and applied them to this gene. The RvNaRL knockdown and knockout cells exhibited significant growth only when ammonium was supplied but, in contrast to the wild-type cells, no substantial growth when nitrate was supplied. Such arrested growth in absence of ammonium was attributed to impaired amino acid synthesis due to the deficiency of nitrogen supply from the nitrate assimilation pathway; this in turn resulted in the accumulation of excess photosynthetic products in the form of cytosolic polysaccharide grains as observed.

Despite identifying many disease-associated DNA variants through genome-wide association studies, distinguishing deleterious non-coding DNA variations remains poor for most common diseases. We previously reported that non-coding variations disrupting cis-overlapping motifs (CisOMs) of opposing transcription factors significantly affect enhancer activity. Analyzing publicly available ChIP-seq data for P53 and cMYC in human embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic cells showed that [~]344-366 genomic regions are co-occupied by P53 and cMYC. We identified, on average, two CisOMs per region, suggesting that co-occupancy is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. Therefore, we designed in vitro experiments to uncover the significance of the co-occupancy and competitive binding and inhibition between P53 and cMYC on target gene expression. We found that treating U2OS cells with doxorubicin increased P53 protein level while reducing cMYC level. In contrast, no change in protein levels was observed in Raji cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that 16-922 genomic regions were co-occupied by P53 and cMYC before and after treatment, and substitutions of cMYC signals by P53 were detected after doxorubicin treatment in U2OS. Around 187 expressed genes near co-occupied regions were altered at mRNA level according to RNA-seq data. We utilized a computational motif-matching approach to determine that changes in predicted P53 binding affinity by DNA variations in CisOMs of co-occupied elements significantly correlate with alterations in reporter gene expression. We performed a similar analysis using SNPs mapped in CisOMs for P53 and cMYC from ChIP-seq data in U2OS and Raji, and expression of target genes from the GTEx portal. We found a significant correlation between change in motif-predicted cMYC binding affinity by SNPs in CisOMs and gene expression. In conclusion, our study suggests a generally applicable approach to filter etiological non-coding variations associated with P53 and cMYC-dependent diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryMost DNA variants associated with common complex diseases fall outside the protein-coding regions of the genome, making them hard to detect and relate to a function. Although many computational tools are available for prioritizing functional disease risk variants outside the protein-coding regions of the genome, the precision of prediction of these tools is mostly unreliable and hence not close to cancer risk prediction. This study brings to light a novel way to improve prediction accuracy of publicly available tools by integrating the impact of cis-overlapping binding sites of opposing cancer proteins, such as P53 and cMYC, in their analysis to filter out deleterious DNA variants outside the protein-coding regions of the human genome. Using a biology-based statistical approach, DNA variants within cis-overlapping motifs impacting the binding affinity of opposing transcription factors can significantly alter the expression of target genes and regulatory networks. This study brings us closer to developing a generally applicable approach capable of filtering etiological non-coding variations in co-occupied genomic regions of P53 and cMYC family members to improve disease risk assessment.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/05/2022.12.05.519089"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.05.519134", "title": "Nanopore sequencing identifies a higher frequency and expanded spectrum of mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations in human aging", "authors": "Vandiver, A.; Hoang, A.; Herbst, A.; Lee, C.

Mapping the mutation spectrum and quantifying mtDNA deletion mutation frequency is challenging with next generation sequencing methods. We hypothesized that long-read sequencing of human mtDNA across the lifespan would detect a broader spectrum of mtDNA rearrangements and provide a more accurate measurement of their frequency.\n\nResultsWe employed nanopore Cas9-targed sequencing (nCATS) to map and quantitate mtDNA deletion mutations and develop analyses that are fit-for-purpose. We analyzed total DNA from vastus lateralis muscle in 15 males ranging from 20 to 81 years of age and substantia nigra from three 20-year-old and three 79-year-old men. We found that mtDNA deletion mutations detected by nCATS increased exponentially with age and mapped to a wider region of the mitochondrial genome than previously reported. Using simulated data, we observed that large deletions are often reported as chimeric alignments. To address this, we developed two algorithms for deletion identification which yield consistent deletion mapping and identify both previously reported and novel mtDNA deletion breakpoints. The identified mtDNA deletion frequency measured by nCATS correlates strongly with chronological age and predicts the deletion frequency as measured by digital PCR approaches. In substantia nigra, we observed a similar frequency of age-related mtDNA deletions to those observed in muscle samples, but noted a distinct spectrum of deletion breakpoints.\n\nConclusionsNCATS-mtDNA sequencing allows identification of mtDNA deletions on a single molecule level, characterizing the strong relationship between mtDNA deletion frequency and chronological aging.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/05/2022.12.05.519134"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.05.519169", "title": "Pre-epidemic evolution of the USA300 clade and a molecular key for classification", "authors": "Bianco, C.; Moustafa, A.; OBrien, K.; Martin, M.; Read, T.; Kreiswirth, B.

Large sequencing databases, such as NCBI, PATRIC, and Staphopia, contain clues to the early evolution of USA300 in the form of sequenced genomes of USA300 isolates that are representative of lineages that diverged prior to the establishment of the South American (SAE) and North American (NAE) epidemics.

We use database mining techniques to emphasize genomes similar to pre-epidemic isolates, with the goal of reconstructing the early molecular evolution of the USA300 lineage.

One proposed mechanism for meiotic drivers to achieve biased transmission is by sabotaging essential processes of gametogenesis (e.g. spermatogenesis), leading to demise of gametes that contain their opponents (1). Studies in D. simulans have recently found that a set of meiotic driver genes contain a sequence homologous to protamines (4, 5), critical proteins that package sperm chromatin (6-8). However, the underlying mechanisms of drive and the relevance of protamine-like sequences in meiotic drive remain unknown. While studying the function of Modulo, the homolog of Nucleolin in Drosophila melanogaster (9, 10), we unexpectedly discovered Y-linked protamine genes function as a meiotic driver: we found that modulo mutants known sterility is caused by deregulation of the autosomal protamine-like gene (Mst77F) and its Y chromosome-linked homolog (Mst77Y). Modulo regulates these genes at the step of polyadenylation of the transcripts. We show that Mst77Y likely acts as a dominant-negative form of Mst77F, interfering with the process of histone-to-protamine transition, leading to nuclear decompaction. Overexpression of Mst77Y in a wild-type background is sufficient to cause nuclear decompaction and results in the biased demise of X chromosome-bearing sperm. We propose that dominant-negative protamine variants may be a common strategy found in male meiotic drive and may explain known rapid divergence of protamine genes.\n\nSignificance statementProtamines are small, highly positively charged proteins that are required for packaging DNA to produce mature sperm with highly-condensed nuclei capable of fertilization. Even small changes in the dosage of protamines in humans is associated with infertility. Yet, despite their essential function, protamines are rapidly evolving. It has been speculated that protamines rapid divergence may be explained by their potential participation in genomic conflict. Our work implicates the involvement of Y chromosome-linked multicopy protamine-like genes in meiotic drive in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that dominant negative protamines can sabotage the process of nuclear compaction during spermiogenesis, revealing a potential cellular mechanism of sperm killing in meiotic drive.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/05/2022.12.04.519051"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.04.519060", "title": "In situ quantification of osmotic pressure within living embryonic tissues", "authors": "Vian, A.; Pochitaloff, M.; Yen, S.-T.; Kim, S.; Pollock, J.; Liu, Y.; Sletten, E.

The GL haplotype (S_614G and NS8_48L) was the major haplotype driving the global pandemic and accounted for 99.2% of the sequenced genomes, while the DL haplotype (S_614D and NS8_48L) caused the pandemic in China in the spring of 2020 and accounted for approximately 60% of the genomes in China and 0.45% of the global genomes.

However, they arrived and evolved into toxic strains and ignited a pandemic in China where the GL strains did not exist at the end of 2019. The GL strains had spread all over the world before they were discovered, and ignited the global pandemic, which had not been noticed until the pandemic was declared in China. However, the GL haplotype had little influence in China during the early phase of the pandemic due to its late arrival as well as the strict transmission controls in China.

The tetrameric cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE) contributes to H2S biogenesis and several investigations provide evidence on the pharmacological modulation of CSE as a potential target for the treatment of a multitude of conditions. D-penicillamine (D-pen) has recently been reported to selectively impede CSE-catalyzed H2S production but the molecular bases for such inhibitory effect have not been investigated. In this study, we report that D-pen follows a mixed-inhibition mechanism to inhibit both cystathionine (CST) cleavage and H2S biogenesis by human CSE. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying such a mixed inhibition, we performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Interestingly, MD analysis of CST binding reveals a likely active site configuration prior to gem-diamine intermediate formation, particularly H-bond formation between the amino group of the substrate and the O3 of PLP. Similar analyses realized with both CST and D-pen identified three potent interfacial ligand-binding sites for D-pen and offered a rational for D-pen effect. Thus, inhibitor binding not only induces the creation of an entirely new interacting network at the vicinity of the interface between enzyme subunits, but it also exerts long range effects by propagating to the active site. Overall, our study paved the way for the design of new allosteric interfacial inhibitory compounds that will specifically modulate H2S biogenesis by cystathionine {gamma}-lyase.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519292v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6d57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3898forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec1804org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ce3e9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/06/2022.12.06.519292"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.05.519208", "title": "The Axin scaffold protects the kinase GSK3β from cross-pathway inhibition", "authors": "Gavagan, M.; Jameson, N.; Zalatan, J.

HCA is more effective than traditional stone medications in inhibiting CaOx deposition and kidney damage. Further cellular transcriptomic analysis and in vitro results showed that HCA could stably bind peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) and promote PPAR-RXR heterodimer formation, thus promoting the expression of downstream oxidative stress molecules (Nrf2, HO-1, SOD) and inhibiting calcium ion release and mitochondrial dysfunction, thus reducing oxalate-induced renal lipid peroxidation damage.

This pathway produces a 150 kDa peptide oligomer (approximately 32 peptide molecules or protomers) that does not aggregate further into amyloid fibrils. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed structural features distinguishing the 150 kDa oligomer from fibrils. A puzzling feature was the coexistence of parallel and antiparallel {beta}-sheets within the oligomer structure. Here we present new atomic-level structural constraints obtained via solid-state NMR spectroscopy, benefitting from improved resolution via sample concentration by ultracentrifugation. In addition, two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction revealed a 4-fold symmetric shape. We propose a structural model to rationalize the solid-sate NMR- and cryo-EM-derived structural constraints. This model has a hollow square cylinder shape, with antiparallel {beta}-sheets formed by residues 33-39 lining the inner walls and parallel {beta}-sheets formed by residues 11-22 lining the outer walls. Within successive layers, the outer {beta}-strands on each side of the square cylinder alternate between two forms: one within a U-shaped protomer and another within L-shaped protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations show that, when the oligomer model is embedded in a lipid membrane, ions permeate through the central pore, with cation selectivity. The model further motivates an assembly pathway-based interpretation that may explain why the 150 kDa oligomer does not undergo further aggregation into amyloid fibrils.\n\nSignificance StatementA{beta} oligomers are thought to be the most toxic species in Alzheimers disease. Their sizes range from 2 to [~]50 protomers. Most published experimental data on A{beta} oligomers indicate that they, like fibrils, are composed of {beta}-sheets, but it is a mystery why any {beta}-sheet aggregate would exist as a stable oligomer without undergoing further aggregation into fibrils. Here, structural constraints from solid-state NMR and cryo-EM led us to an oligomer model with a hollow square cylinder shape capable of conducting ions when embedded in a lipid membrane. Based on the model, we argue that geometric frustration may distinguish the assembly pathway that produces this oligomer from fibril-forming assembly pathways.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/06/2022.12.06.519347"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.06.518574", "title": "A high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM hydrated structure of Streptococcus pyogenes enolase offers insights into its function as a plasminogen receptor", "authors": "Tjia-Fleck, S.; Readnour, B.; Ayinuola, Y.

After the subtraction, SNP heritability reduced from 6.3% to 3.3% for pure happiness and from 6.2% to 4.2% for pure meaning. The genetic correlation between the well-being measures reduced from .78 to .65, indicating that only a part of the genetic overlap between happiness and meaning in life is due to overlap with depressive symptoms.

Furthermore, we observe mutant cells in histologically normal tissue surrounding one tumor, which were not discernible upon histopathologic evaluation. Finally, we detected mono-allelic expression of immunoglobulin heavy chains in B-cells, revealing clonal populations of plasma cells surrounding one tumor. In summary, we put forward solutions to add the genetic dimension to spatial transcriptomic datasets, augmenting the potential of this new technology.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.12.05.519162"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.04.518984", "title": "Discordant results among MHC binding affinity prediction tools", "authors": "Nguyen, A.; Nellore, A.; Thompson, R.

Resistance mechanisms likely cause changes that profoundly affect mosquito physiology, yet it remains poorly understood how selective pressures imposed by insecticides may alter the ability of the mosquito to host and transmit a Plasmodium infection. From pyrethroid-resistant field-derived Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes, we performed selection experiments to establish resistant (RES) and susceptible (SUS) colonies by either selection for, or loss of, insecticide resistance. We show increased prevalence, intensity, and oocyst growth rate of Plasmodium falciparum infection in RES females compared to SUS. The increase in infection intensity in RES females was not associated with the presence of the kdrL1014F mutation, and was not impacted by inhibition of Cytochrome P450s. The lipid transporter lipophorin (Lp), which was upregulated in RES compared to SUS, was at least partly implicated in the increased intensity of P. falciparum but not directly in the insecticide resistance phenotype. Interestingly, we observed that although P. falciparum infections were not affected when RES females were exposed to permethrin, these females had decreased lipid abundance in the fat body following exposure, pointing to a possible role for lipid mobilization in response to damage caused by insecticide challenge. The finding that selection for insecticide resistance can increase P. falciparum infection intensities and growth rate reinforces the need to assess the overall impact on malaria transmission dynamics of selective pressures mosquitoes experience during repeated insecticide challenge.\n\nSignificance StatementInsecticide resistance poses a severe threat for malaria control. Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, the active component of most insecticide-treated nets, is now widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing the efficacy of these crucial tools. Despite significant research characterizing insecticide resistance mechanisms, it remains unknown how these traits influence Plasmodium falciparum infections in malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes. We established a pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible population of Anopheles gambiae derived from the same genetic background and performed experimental infections with P. falciparum. We found that the pyrethroid-resistant population was more supportive of malaria parasites compared to the susceptible population. This was not caused by well-known insecticide resistance mechanisms, but linked with a lipid transporter, lipophorin, which may play an indirect role in resistance.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.12.07.516767"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.07.519501", "title": "Genome-wide analysis of DNA-PK-bound MRN cleavage products supports a sequential model of DSB repair pathway choice", "authors": "Deshpande, R.

Canonical initiation of translation in eukaryotes involves recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the 5' end of mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F to form the 48S initiation complex (48S), followed by scanning along the mRNA until the start codon is selected.1-8 We have previously shown that eIF4F binds near the mRNA channel exit site of the 43S, leaving an open question about how mRNA secondary structure is removed as it enters the mRNA binding channel on the other side of the 40S subunit.4 Here we describe a human 48S positioned at the start codon that shows that in addition to the eIF4A that is part of eIF4F, there is a second eIF4A helicase bound to the mRNA entry site. The entry channel bound eIF4A is positioned through interactions with eIF3 and the 40S subunit to enable its ATP-dependent helicase activity to directly unwind secondary structure located downstream of the scanning 48S complex. The structure also reveals universally conserved interactions between eIF4F and the 48S, likely explaining how this complex can promote mRNA recruitment in all eukaryotes. mRNA translation has emerged as an important tool for developing innovative therapies, yet several fundamental aspects of its regulation remain unknown.

DNA sequences can exhibit marked compositional difference. Such compositional heterogeneity implies sequence divergence has arisen from substitution processes that differ between the lineages. Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in exploring the non-stationary model class, which is capable of generating divergent sequence composition. These models are typically parameter rich and this richness is further compounded by the use of time-heterogeneous variants in order to capture compositional heterogeneity. This illuminates two barriers limiting the widespread application of the non-stationary model class: both the compute-time required to fit a model and the risk of model over-fitting increase with the number of parameters and the extent of time-heterogeneity. In this study, we address these issues with a novel model selection algorithm we term the Inherited Rate Matrix algorithm (hereafter IRM). This approach is based on the notion that a species inherits the substitution tendencies of its ancestor. We further present the non-stationary heterogeneous across lineages model (hereafter ns-HAL algorithm) which extends the HAL algorithm of Jayaswal et al. [2014] to the general nucleotide Markov process. The IRM algorithm substantially reduces the complexity of identifying a sufficient solution to the problem of time-heterogeneous substitution processes across lineages. We also address the issue of reducing the computing time with development of a constrained-optimisation approach for the IRM algorithm (fast-IRM). Our algorithms are implemented in Python 3. From a simulation study based on 2nd codon position genome sequences of yeast, we establish that IRM is significantly more accurate than both ns-HAL and heterogeneity in the substitution process across lineages (hereafter HAL) for close and dispersed sequences. IRM is up to 70x faster than ns-HAL while fast-IRM is around 140x faster. fast-IRM also showed a marked speed improvement over a C++ implementation of HAL. Our comparison of the accuracy of IRM with fast-IRM showed no difference with identical inferences made for all data sets.

During nutrient stress, YIPF4 is mobilized into ATG8-positive vesicles that traffic to lysosomes as measured via Golgiphagy flux reporters in a process that requires the VPS34 and ULK1-FIP200 arms of the autophagy system. Cells lacking YIPF3 or YIPF4 are selectively defective in elimination of Golgi membrane proteins during nutrient stress. By merging absolute protein abundance with autophagic turnover, we create a global protein census describing how autophagic degradation maps onto protein abundance and subcellular localization. Our results, available via an interactive web tool, reveal that autophagic turnover prioritizes membrane-bound organelles (principally Golgi and ER) for proteome remodeling during nutrient stress.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryDuring nutrient stress, macroautophagy uses organelle-phagy receptors to prioritize recycling of Golgi and ER membrane proteins.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/07/2022.12.06.519342"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.06.519344", "title": "Genetic Mapping of Progressive Ethanol Consumption in the Diversity Outbred Mouse", "authors": "Tatom, Z.; Mignogna, K.

Here we describe protocols using two transformations to construct strains that carry a new controller, in which all these drawbacks are overcome. In these strains, the expression of a controlled gene (gene of interest, or GOI) is repressed by the bacterial repressor TetR, and induced by anhydrotetracycline. TetR also regulates its own expression, creating an autorepression loop. This autorepression allows tight control of gene expression/ protein dosage with low cell to cell variation in expression. A second repressor, TetR-Tup1, prevents any leaky expression. We also present a protocol showing a particular workhorse application of such strains, to generate synchronized cell populations. We turn off the expression of the cell cycle regulator CDC20 completely, arresting the cell population, and then back on so that the synchronized cells resume cell cycle progression.

As one of the distinguishing features of DSS is the elevated pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract, it is theorized that the membrane formation is caused by elevated wall shear stress applied to the endocardial endothelial cells (EECs), triggering fibrosis. To relate shear stress to an EEC fibrotic phenotype, we applied fluid shear stress to EECs at physiological and pathological shear rates using a cone-and-plate device. Upon characterization of the EECs after the shear experiments, elevated shear stress triggered cell alignment as well as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) signaling pathways driven by upregulation of SNAI1 gene expression. The EECs were then treated with a small molecule inhibitor of Snail1 protein, CYD19, to attempt to attenuate EndMT signaling, and subsequently subjected to pathological shear stress. We found the Snail1 inhibitor did downregulate selected markers of EndMT signaling, although only transiently. Interestingly, the application of shear stress had a far greater effect on the EEC gene and protein expression in comparison to the Snail1 inhibition.

However current models often fall short of predicted response where reproducibility is limited owing to the lack of standardized methodology and established protocols. This meta-analysis aims to assess the current scope of 3D OvCa models and the differences in genetic profile presented by a vast array of 3D cultures. A meta-analysis of the literature (Pubmed.gov) spanning 2012 - 2022, was used to identify studies with comparable monolayer (2D) counterparts in addition to RNA sequencing and microarray data.

Label-free techniques such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) enable the characterization of biomolecular interactions through kinetics measurements, typically by binding antigens in solution to monoclonal antibodies immobilized on a SPR chip. 1:1 Langmuir binding model is commonly used to fit the kinetics data and derive rate constants. However, in certain contexts it is necessary to immobilize the antigen to the chip and flow the antibodies in solution. One such scenario is the screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for breadth against a range of antigens, where a bivalent analyte binding model is required to adequately describe the kinetics data unless antigen immobilizaion density is optimized to eliminate avidity effects. A bivalent analyte model is offered in several existing software packages intended for standard throughput SPR instruments, but lacking for high throughput SPR instruments. Existing methods also do not explore multiple local minima and parameter identifiability, issues common in non-linear optimization. Here, we have developed a method for analyzing bivalent analyte binding kinetics directly applicable to high throughput SPR data collected in a non-regenerative fashion, and have included a grid search on initial parameter values and a profile likelihood method to determine parameter identifiability. We fit the data of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 mAb binding to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to a system of ordinary differential equations modeling bivalent binding. Our identifiability analysis discovered a non-identifiable parameter when data is collected under the standard experimental design for monitoring the association and dissociation phases. We used simulations to determine an improved experimental design, which when executed, resulted in the reliable estimation of all rate constants. These methods will be valuable tools in analyzing the binding of mAbs to an array of antigens to expedite therapeutic antibody discovery research.\n\n2 Author summaryWhile commercial software programs for the analysis of bivalent analyte binding kinetics are available for low-throughput instruments, they cannot be easily applied to data generated by high-throughput instruments, particularly when the chip surface is not regenerated between titration cycles. Further, existing software does not address common issues in fitting non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) such as optimizations getting trapped in local minima or parameters that are not identifiable. In this work, we introduce a pipeline for analysis of bivalent analyte binding kinetics that 1) allows for the use of high-throughput, non-regenerative experimental designs, 2) optimizes using several sets of initial parameter values to ensure that the algorithm is able to reach the lowest minimum error and 3) applies a profile likelihood method to explore parameter identifiability. In our experimental application of the method, we found that one of the kinetics parameters (kd2) cannot be reliably estimated with the standard length of the dissociation phase. Using simulation and identifiability analysis we determined the optimal length of dissociation so that the parameter can be reliably estimated, saving time and reagents.

Adaptation is one such biological property of paramount importance, which aids in regulation in the face of environmental disturbances. In this paper, we present a nonlinear systems theory-driven framework to identify the design principles for perfect adaptation in the presence of large disturbances. Based on the input-output configuration of the network, we use invariant manifold methods to deduce the condition for perfect adaptation to constant input disturbances. Subsequently, we translate these conditions to necessary structural requirements for adaptation in networks of small size. We then extend these results to argue that there exist only two classes of architectures for a network of any size that can provide local adaptation in the entire state space--namely, incoherent feed-forward structure and negative feedback loop with buffer node. The additional positiveness constraints further restrict the admissible set of network structures--this also aids in establishing the global asymptotic stability for the steady state given a constant input disturbance. The entire method does not assume any explicit knowledge of the underlying rate kinetics barring some minimal assumptions. Finally, we also discuss the infeasibility of the incoherent feed-forward structure to provide adaptation in the presence of downstream connections.

Parasites without pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes are not detected by these RDTs. Pfhrp3 loss appears to be more common in some geographical regions and has been observed in vitro. We sought to gain insight into geographic patterns of pfhrp3 deletion and define the mechanism of gene loss.\n\nMethodsOver 9,830 publicly available, whole-genome sequenced (WGS) P. falciparum field samples were analyzed for genotypes and coverage using Pathweaver for local assembly. DNA from two cultured isolates with pfhrp3 deletion, HB3 and SD01, were sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing, assembled with Canu and Flye, and genes annotated with Companion.\n\nResultsTwo distinct pfhrp3 deletion patterns were detected: 1) segmental deletion of chromosome 13 just centromeric to pfhrp3 extending to the end of the chromosome, with co-occurring segmental duplication of the chromosome 11 subtelomeric region, and 2) segmental deletion of chromosome 13 starting at various locations centromeric to pfhrp3 without chromosome 11 duplication. Pattern 1 was almost exclusively found in samples from Africa and South America, while pattern 2 was observed predominantly in Southeast Asia. The pattern 1 boundary fell within a 15kb nearly identical duplication on both chromosomes containing ribosomal genes. ONT assembly of HB3 and SD01 parasite lines revealed hybrid chromosomes and long-reads spanning the ribosomal duplication, consistent with recombination between non-homologous chromosomes.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate duplication-mediated non-homologous recombination creating a hybrid 13-11 chromosome that replaces pfhrp3 and telomeric chromosome 13 with a translocated telomeric chromosome 11 sequence--essentially yielding a deletion of chromosome 13 sequence and interchromosomal duplication of chromosome 11 sequence. Given that existing ribosomal duplications likely predispose to the frequent occurrence of this translocation during meiosis, it suggests that subsequent selective forces are driving its presence or absence in different geographical regions.

However, very few have actually been successfully targeted and many are considered  undruggable. This is particularly true for proteins that function via protein-protein interactions: direct inhibition of binding interfaces is difficult, requiring the identification of allosteric sites. However, most proteins have no known allosteric sites and a comprehensive allosteric map does not exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by charting multiple global atlases of inhibitory allosteric communication in KRAS, a protein mutated in 1 in 10 human cancers. We quantified the impact of >26,000 mutations on the folding of KRAS and its binding to six interaction partners. Genetic interactions in double mutants allowed us to perform biophysical measurements at scale, inferring >22,000 causal free energy changes, a similar number of measurements as the total made for proteins to date. These energy landscapes quantify how mutations tune the binding specificity of a signalling protein and map the inhibitory allosteric sites for an important therapeutic target. Allosteric propagation is particularly effective across the central beta sheet of KRAS and multiple surface pockets are genetically-validated as allosterically active, including a distal pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the protein. Allosteric mutations typically inhibit binding to all tested effectors but they can also change the binding specificity, revealing the regulatory, evolutionary and therapeutic potential to tune pathway activation.

If such comparability is not evident, the generalizability of results obtained using the ATN framework is at question. In this work, we evaluated the impact of selecting specific thresholding methods on ATN profiles by applying five commonly-used methodologies across eleven AD cohort studies. Our findings revealed high variability among the obtained thresholds, both across methods and datasets, linking the choice of thresholding method directly to the type I and type II error rate of ATN profiling. Moreover, we assessed the generalizability of primarily Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) derived biological patterns discovered within ATN profiles by simultaneously clustering participants of different cohorts who were assigned to the same ATN profile. In only two out of seven investigated ATN profiles, we observed a significant association between individuals assigned clusters and cohort origin for thresholds defined using Gaussian Mixture Models, while no significant associations were found for K-means-derived thresholds. Consequently, in the majority of profiles, biological signals governed the clustering rather than systematic cohort differences resulting from distinct biomarker thresholds. Our work revealed that: 1) the thresholding method selection is a decision of statistical relevance that will inevitably bias the resulting profiling, 2) obtained thresholds are most likely not directly interchangeably across two independent cohorts, and 3) MRI-based biological patterns derived from distinctly thresholded ATN profiles can generalize across cohort datasets. Conclusively, in order to appropriately apply the ATN framework as an actionable and robust biological profiling scheme, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of used thresholding methods, their statistical implications, and the validation of achieved results is crucial.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.06.519269"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.05.519223", "title": "BCLncRDB: A comprehensive database of LncRNAs associated with breast cancer", "authors": "Kumar, S.; Agarwal, A.; Vindal, V.", "author_corresponding": "Vaibhav Vindal", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, 500046", "date": "2022-12-08", "category": "bioinformatics", "abstract": "MotivationBreast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide.

We also performed enzyme inhibition for further mechanistic analysis and a systematic review to align any changes in metabolomics during muscle growth with previous findings.\n\nResultsBoth our metabolomics analysis and the systematic review reveal altered metabolite concentrations in anabolic pathways such as in the pentose phosphate and serine synthesis pathway to build up biomass, as well as in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that serves as a basis for the post-translational so-called O-linked glycosylation modification. We further demonstrated that labelled carbon from [U-13C6]glucose is increasingly incorporated into the non-essential amino acids in hypertrophying myotubes.

These so-called lysine deserts show a high prevalence in intrinsically disordered proteins with known or predicted functions within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), including many E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and UBL domain proteasome substrate shuttles, such as BAG6, RAD23A, UBQLN1 and UBQLN2. We show that introduction of lysine residues into the deserts leads to a striking increase in ubiquitylation of some of these proteins. In case of BAG6, we show that ubiquitylation is catalyzed by the E3 RNF126, while RAD23A is ubiquitylated by E6AP. Despite the elevated ubiquitylation, mutant RAD23A appears stable, but displays a partial loss of function phenotype in fission yeast. In case of UBQLN1 and BAG6, introducing lysine leads to a reduced abundance due to proteasomal degradation of the proteins. For UBQLN1 we show that arginine residues within the lysine depleted region are critical for its ability to form cytosolic inclusions. We propose that selective pressure to avoid lysine residues may be a common evolutionary mechanism to prevent unwarranted ubiquitylation and/or perhaps other lysine post-translational modifications. This may be particularly relevant for UPS components as they closely and frequently encounter the ubiquitylation machinery and are thus more susceptible to non-specific ubiquitylation.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.08.519562"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.08.518878", "title": "A multi-parameter optimization in middle-down analysis of monoclonal antibodies by LC-MS/MS", "authors": "Dhenin, J.

The biomolecular consequences of variations in sHSP ratios, especially inside living cells, remain elusive. Here, we study the consequences of altering the relative expression levels of HspB2 and HspB3. These chaperones are partners in a hetero-oligomeric complex, and genetic mutations that abolish their mutual interaction are associated with myopathic disorders.\n\nHspB2 displays three distinct phenotypes when co-expressed with HspB3 at varying ratios. Expression of HspB2 alone lead to formation of liquid nuclear condensates, while shifting the stoichiometry towards HspB3 resulted in the formation of large solid-like aggregates. Only cells co-expressing HspB2 with a limited amount of HspB3 showed a homogeneous nuclear distribution of HspB2. Strikingly, both condensates and aggregates were reversible, as shifting the HspB2:HspB3 balance in situ resulted in dissolution of these structures.\n\nTo uncover the molecular composition of HspB2 condensates and aggregates, we used APEX-mediated proximity labelling.

This precision bred, proof-of-concept animal provides the first evidence that intentional genome alterations in CD46 may reduce the burden of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle, and is consistent with our stepwise, in vitro and ex vivo experiments with cell lines and matched fetal clones.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.08.519336"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.06.519258", "title": "ChILL & DisCO to discover competitive, connective and allosteric Nanobodies that modulate the SOS1-RAS protein-protein interactions and tune the nucleotide exchange rate", "authors": "Fischer, B.; Uchanski, T.; Sheryazdanova, A.; Gonzalez, S.; Volkov, A.; Brosens, E.; Zogg, T.; Kalichuk, V.; Ballet, S.; Versees, W.; Sablina, A.; Pardon, E.; Wohlkonig, A.; Steyaert, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jan Steyaert", "author_corresponding_institution": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel", "date": "2022-12-08", "category": "bioengineering", "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central in cell metabolism but research tools for the structural and functional characterization of these PPIs are often missing.

We applied ChILL and DisCO to identify competitive, connective or fully allosteric Nanobodies that inhibit or facilitate the formation of the SOS1*RAS complex and modulate the nucleotide exchange rate on this pivotal GTPase in vitro and RAS signalling in cellulo. One of these connective Nanobodies fills a cavity that was previously identified as the binding pocket for a series of therapeutic lead compounds. The long complementarity-determining region (CDR3) that penetrates this binding pocket serves as an innovative pharmacophore for extending the repertoire of potential leads.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.06.519258"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.07.519177", "title": "Functional characterization of cytochrome P450s associated with pyrethroid resistance in the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae", "authors": "Kampouraki, A.; Tsakireli, D.; Koidou, V.; Stavrakaki, M.; Kaili, S.; Livadaras, I.; Grigoraki, L.; Ioannidis, P.; Roditakis, E.; Vontas, J.", "author_corresponding": "John Vontas", "author_corresponding_institution": "Pesticide Science Lab, Agricultural University of Athens, 75 Iera Odos, 118 55 Athens, Greece / Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for", "date": "2022-12-08", "category": "molecular biology", "abstract": "Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has evolved in Bactrocera oleae populations in Greece, threatening the efficacy of control interventions based on this insecticide class. Here we report the collection of populations from Crete with resistance levels reaching up to 331-folds, compared to susceptible laboratory strains and show that pyrethroid resistance is substantially suppressed by the PBO synergist, suggesting the involvement of detoxification enzymes. To identify specific candidate genes implicated in resistance, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis, between the pyrethroid resistant populations from Crete and the susceptible laboratory strains, using both whole bodies and Malpighian tubules. Several genes were found differentially transcribed between resistant and susceptible flies in each comparison, with P450s being among the most highly over-expressed detoxification genes in pyrethroid resistant populations. Four of the over-expressed P450s (Cyp6A61, Cyp6G6, Cyp4P6 and Cyp6G28) were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and in vitro metabolism assays revealed that CYP6A61 is capable of metabolizing alpha-cypermethrin, while CYP6G6, CYP4P6 and CYP6G28 are capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. No metabolism of neonicotinoid insecticides was recorded. We further silenced CYP6G6 in vivo, via RNAi, which led to a small, but significant increase in deltamethrin toxicity. The study provides valuable information towards the development of molecular diagnostics and evidence-based insecticide resistance management strategies.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.07.519177"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.07.519428", "title": "Time-dependent material properties of ageing biomolecular condensates from different viscoelasticity measurements in molecular dynamics simulations", "authors": "Tejedor, A.

While initially described as liquid-like droplets, the term biomolecular condensates is now used to describe a diversity of condensed phase assemblies with material properties extending from low to high viscous liquids, gels, and even glasses. Because the material properties of condensates are determined by the intrinsic behaviour of their molecules, characterising such properties is integral to rationalising the molecular mechanisms that dictate their functions and roles in health and disease. Here, we apply and compare three distinct computational methods to measure the viscoelasticity of biomolecular condensates in molecular simulations. These methods are the shear stress relaxation modulus integration (SSRMI), the oscillatory shear (OS) technique, and the bead tracking (BT) method. We find that, although all of these methods provide consistent results for the viscosity of the condensates, the SSRMI and OS techniques outperform the BT method in terms of computational efficiency and statistical uncertainty. We, thus, apply the SSRMI and OS techniques for a set of 12 different protein/RNA systems using a sequence-dependent high-resolution coarse-grained model. Our results reveal a strong correlation between condensate viscosity and density, as well as with protein/RNA length and the number of stickers vs. spacers in the amino-acid protein sequence. Moreover, we couple the SSRMI and the OS technique to nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that mimic the progressive liquid-to-gel transition of protein condensates due to the accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets. We compare the behaviour of three different protein condensates--i.e., those formed by either hnRNPA1, FUS, or TDP-43 proteins--whose liquid-to-gel transitions are associated with the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We find that both SSRMI and OS techniques successfully predict the transition from functional liquid-like behaviour to kinetically arrested states once the network of inter-protein {beta}-sheets has percolated through the condensates. Overall, our work provides a comparison of different modelling rheological techniques to assess the viscosity of biomolecular condensates, a critical magnitude that provides information on the behaviour of biomolecules inside condensates.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/08/2022.12.07.519428"}]
