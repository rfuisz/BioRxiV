The problem of protein-ligand interaction is traditionally tackled by molecular docking and simulation based on physical forces and statistical potentials, which cannot effectively leverage cryo-EM data and existing protein structural information in the protein-ligand modeling process. In this work, we developed a deep learning bioinformatics pipeline (DeepProLigand) to predict protein-ligand interactions from cryo-EM density maps of proteins and ligands. DeepProLigand first uses a deep learning method to predict the structure of proteins from cryo-EM maps, which is averaged with a reference (template) structure of the proteins to produce a combined structure to add ligands. The ligands are then identified and added into the structure to generate a protein-ligand complex structure, which is further refined. The method based on the deep learning prediction and template-based modeling was blindly tested in the 2021 EMDataResource Ligand Challenge and was ranked first in fitting ligands to cryo-EM density maps.

Activated Ras transduces the signalling by directly interacting with effector proteins. About a quarter of total human cancers carry mutations in Ras isoforms, and hence understanding the structure and molecular interactions of Ras with effector proteins is of vital importance. Accumulating evidence suggests that small GTPases, RalA and RalB, and their activators, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), play an essential role in oncogenic Ras-induced signalling. We, therefore, studied the interaction between human K-Ras4B and the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Rgl2 (Rgl2RBD) because, among RBD-containing RalGEFs, Rgl2 is predicted to be most significantly in complex with Ras in over 29 human tissues [Catozzi S, Halasz M, & Kiel C (2021) Predicted  wiring landscape of Ras-effector interactions in 29 human tissues. NPJ Syst Biol Appl 7(1):10]. We show that the affinity between K-Ras4B and Rgl2RBD is increased when K-Ras4B carries oncogenic mutation G12V. The crystal structure of the K-Ras4BG12V: Rgl2RBD complex shows that a 2:2 heterotetramer is formed where the Switch I and Switch II regions of each K-RasG12V molecule interact with both Rgl2RBD molecules. This structural arrangement is highly similar to the H-RasE31K:RALGDS crystal structure and is distinct from the well-characterised Ras:RAFRBD complexes. Importantly, the G12V mutation was found at the dimer interface of K-Ras4BG12V with its partner. Solution state NMR and mass photometry analyses support the heterotetramer formation in solution. Our study reveals a distinct mode of Ras:effector complex formation by RalGEFs, and points to a possibility that K-Ras4BG12V oncogenicity originates from the formation of a stable complex with Rgl2.\n\nSignificance StatementThe best-characterised Ras:effector interaction is the Ras:Raf1 kinase complex that leads to ERK activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that oncogenic Ras signalling does not always hyperactivate ERK and Akt pathways, and the less-studied RalA/B pathway may be a key player in oncogenic-Ras induced tumorigenesis. In this work, we report that the G12V oncogenic K-Ras4B mutation substantially increases the affinity with the Ras associating (RA) domain of Rgl2, an activator of RalA/B. The K-Ras4BG12V:Rgl2RA complex forms a heterotetramer, with the oncogenic mutant residue located directly at the K-Ras4BG12V: K-Ras4BG12V interface. The binding mode is structurally distinct from other Ras:effector complexes, offering a possible mechanistic explanation for how the oncogenic K-Ras4BG12V hyperactivates the RalA/B pathway.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/22/2022.10.10.511529"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.20.517270", "title": "Systematic Approach Identifies Multiple Transcription Factor Perturbations That Rejuvenate Replicatively Aged Human Skin Fibroblasts", "authors": "Sengstack, J.; Zheng, J.; Mobaraki, M.; Lin, J.; Deng, C.; Li, H.", "author_corresponding": "Hao Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of California, San Francisco", "date": "2022-11-22", "category": "cell biology", "abstract": "Rejuvenation, long a quixotic dream, recently became a possibility through exciting new approaches to counteract aging.

We set out to develop a systematic approach to identify novel genes that, when overexpressed or repressed, reprogram the global gene expression of a cell back to a younger state. Using the Hayflick model of human cell replicative aging, we performed a Perturb-seq screen of 200 transcription factors (TFs) selected through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and literature search. We identified dozens of potentially rejuvenating TFs--those that when overexpressed or repressed in late passage cells reprogrammed global gene expression patterns back to an earlier passage state. We further validated four top TF perturbations through molecular phenotyping of various aging hallmarks. Late passage cells either overexpressing EZH2 or E2F3 or repressing STAT3 or ZFX had more cell division, less senescence, improved proteostasis, and enhanced mitochondrial function. These TF perturbations led to similar downstream gene expression programs. In addition, the rejuvenating effects of these TFs were independent of telomeres.

Instead, we show that the timely removal of transcripts from mitotic chromatin is driven by the SNF2 helicase-like protein Lodestar (Lds), identified here as a modulator of sister chromatid cohesion defects. In addition to transcriptional termination, we uncovered that Lds cooperates with Topoisomerase 2 to ensure efficient sister chromatid resolution and mitotic fidelity.

By modeling the prior probability of co-accessibility between adjacent peaks as a decreasing function of genomic distance, SCARP is the first scATAC-seq analysis method that utilizes the genomic information of peaks, which contributed to characterizing co-accessibility of peaks. SCARP used network to model the accessible relationships between cells and peaks, aggregated information with the diffusion method, and then performed dimensionality reduction to obtain low-dimensional cell embeddings as well as peak embeddings. We have demonstrated through sufficient experiments that SCARP facilitated superior analysis of scATAC-seq data. Specifically, SCARP exhibited outstanding cell clustering performance to better elucidate cell heterogeneity, and can be used to reveal new biologically significant cell subpopulations. SCARP was also instrumental in portraying co-accessibility relationships of accessible regions and providing new insight into transcriptional regulation, and those SCARP-derived genes were involved in some key KEGG pathways related to diseases.

Nanopore sequencing generates noisy electrical signals that need to be converted into a standard string of DNA nucleotide bases (i.e., A, C, G, T) using a computational step called basecalling. The accuracy and speed of basecalling have critical implications for every subsequent step in genome analysis. Currently, basecallers are mainly based on deep learning techniques to provide high sequencing accuracy without considering the compute demands of such tools. We observe that state-of-the-art basecallers (i.e., Guppy, Bonito) are slow, inefficient, and memory-hungry as researchers have adapted deep learning models from other domains without specialization to the basecalling purpose. Our goal is to make basecalling highly efficient and fast by building the first framework for specializing and optimizing machine learning-based basecaller. We introduce RUBICON, a framework to develop hardware-optimized basecallers. RUBICON consists of two novel machine-learning techniques that are specifically designed for basecalling. First, we introduce the quantization-aware basecalling neural architecture search (QABAS) framework to specialize the basecalling neural network architecture for a given hardware acceleration platform while jointly exploring and finding the best bit-width precision for each neural network layer. Second, we develop SkipClip, the first technique to remove all the skip connections present in modern basecallers to greatly reduce resource and storage requirements without any loss in basecalling accuracy. We demonstrate the benefits of QABAS and SkipClip by developing RUBICALL, the first hardware-optimized basecaller that performs fast and accurate basecalling. Our experimental results on state-of-the-art computing systems show that RUBICALL is a fast, accurate and hardware-friendly, mixed-precision basecaller.

Here, we report that recognition of Lamins A/C by a commonly used antibody (JOL-2) that binds the Lamin A/C Ig-fold and other antibodies targeting similar epitopes is highly dependent on cell density, even though Lamin A/C protein levels do not change with cell density. The density-dependent Lamin A/C labeling was distinct from previously reported differential apico-basal labeling, which was independent of cell density. Comparison of the density-dependent labeling effects of antibodies recognizing different Lamin A/C epitopes suggests that the effect is caused by partial unfolding or masking of the CE and/or EF loops of the Ig-fold in response to cell spreading. Seeding cells on micropatterned surfaces with different areas confirmed that increased cell spreading resulted in reduced Lamin A/C labeling with the JOL-2 antibody. Surprisingly, JOL-2 antibody labeling was insensitive to depolymerization of cytoskeletal filaments or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. Although the density-dependent changes of the Ig-fold did not alter nuclear stiffness or nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission, they may nonetheless modulate interaction with lamin binding partners and thereby affect cellular functions.

Structured illumination microscopy revealed gradual accumulation of ALIX at the midbody, resulting in the formation of spiral-like structures extending from the midbody to the abscission site, which strongly co-localized with CHMP4B. Live-cell microscopy uncovered that ALIX appeared together with CHMP4B in vesicular structures, whose motility was microtubule-dependent. Depletion of ALIX led to structural alterations of the midbody and delayed recruitment of CHMP4B, resulting in delayed abscission. Likewise, depletion of the kinesin-1 motor KIF5B reduced the motility of ALIX-positive vesicles and caused delayed recruitment of ALIX, TSG101 and CHMP4B to the midbody, accompanied by impeded abscission.

Representing ECM and cell-ECM interactions is a challenging multi-scale problem that acts across the tissue and cell scales. While several computational frameworks exist for ECM modeling, they typically focus on very detailed modeling of individual ECM fibers or represent only a single aspect of the ECM. Using the PhysiCell agent-based modeling platform, we combine aspects of previous modeling efforts and develop a framework of intermediate detail that addresses direct cell-ECM interactions. We represent a small region of ECM as an ECM element containing 3 variables: anisotropy, density, and orientation. We then place many ECM elements through a space to form an ECM. Cells have a mechanical response to the local ECM variables and remodel ECM based on their velocity. We demonstrate aspects of this framework with a model of cell invasion where the cells motile phenotype is driven by the ECM microstructure patterned by prior cells movements. Investigating the limit of high-speed communication and with stepwise introduction of the framework features, we generate a range of cellular dynamics and ECM patterns - from recapitulating a homeostatic tissue, to indirect communication of paths (stigmergy), to collective migration. When we relax the high-speed communication assumption, we find that the behaviors persist but can be lost as rate of signal generation declines.

We investigated whether substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of ACAD8 and SBCAD can limit the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates in disorders of valine and isoleucine metabolism. Using analysis of acylcarnitine isomers, we show that 2-methylenecyclopropaneacetic acid (MCPA) inhibited SBCAD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, but not ACAD8. MCPA treatment of wild-type and PA HEK-293 cells caused a pronounced decrease in C3-carnitine. Furthermore, deletion of ACADSB in HEK-293 cells led to an equally strong decrease in C3-carnitine when compared to wild-type cells. Deletion of ECHS1 in HEK-293 cells caused a defect in lipoylation of the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was not rescued by ACAD8 deletion. MCPA was able to rescue lipoylation in ECHS1 KO cells, but only in cells with prior ACAD8 deletion.

First we present evidence that YTHDF1 interacts with the sole O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Second, we verified the YTHDF1 O-GlcNAcylation sites to be Ser196/Ser197/Ser198, as described in previous numerous chemoproteomic studies.

Moreover, we revealed that YTHDF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, whose nuclear export is mediated by Crm1. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation increases the cytosolic portion of YTHDF1 by enhancing binding with Crm1, thus upregulating the downstream target (e.g. c-Myc) expression. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that O-GlcNAcylation at S197 might promote the binding between the nuclear export signal motif and Crm1 through increasing hydrogen bonding.

Although the spatial organization of the cell surface glycocalyx is critical for mediating the binding of ligands, receptors, and macromolecules on the plasma membrane, we currently do not have the methods to quantify the spatial hetero-geneities on live cell surfaces. In this work, we engineer molecular antigen sensors that act as a direct reporter of live cell surface crowding heterogeneities with nanometer spatial resolution. By quantifying the effective binding affinity of IgG monoclonal antibodies to our antigen sensors on reconstituted and live cells, we provide a biophysical understanding of the molecular-to-mesoscale spatial organization of the glycocalyx.

NusG modulates transcription by inhibiting pausing and backtracking; promoting anti-termination on ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons; coupling transcription with translation on mRNA genes; and stimulating Rho-dependent termination on toxic genes. Despite extensive work on NusG, its functional allocation and spatial distribution in vivo is unknown. Here, we addressed these long-standing questions using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging of NusG in live E. coli cells. We found that, under conditions of moderate growth, NusG is mainly present as a population that associates indirectly with the chromosome via RNAP in transcription elongation complexes, and a slowly diffusing population we identified as a NusG complex with the 30S ribosomal subunit; this complex offers a \"30S-guided\" path for NusG to enter transcription elongation. Only ~10% of total NusG was fast-diffusing, with the mobility of this population suggesting that free NusG interacts non-specifically with DNA for >50% of the time. Using antibiotics and deletion mutants, we showed that most chromosome-associated NusG is involved in rrn anti-termination and in transcriptiontranslation coupling. NusG involvement in rrn anti-termination was mediated via its participation in phase-separated transcriptional condensates.

The model of Notch receptor activation that is currently most accepted, involves a force-induced conformation change at the negative regulatory region of the receptor, the subsequent recruitment of ADAM metalloproteases and a cleavage cascade that releases the Notch intracellular domain. Here, we define conditions that enable force-independent Notch activation through the formation of soluble, long-lived, multivalent ligand-receptor complexes. To investigate how ligand valency affects activation of Notch receptors, we treated iPSc-derived neuroepithelial stem-like (lt-NES) cells with different spatially defined, molecularly precise ligand nanopatterns on DNA origami nanostructures. Our data indicate that Notch signaling is activated via stimulation with multivalent clusters of the ligand Jag1, and even multivalent chimeric structures where some Jag1 proteins are replaced by other binders that do not target Notch. The findings are corroborated by systematic elimination, through experimental control, of several confounding factors that potentially could generate forces, including electrostatic interactions, endocytosis and non-specific binding. Taken together, our data suggest a model where Jag1 ligands are able to activate Notch receptors upon prolonged binding, which subsequently triggers downstream signaling in a force independent manner. These findings reveal a distinct mode of activation of Notch and could lay the foundation for the development of soluble Notch agonists that currently remain elusive.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/22/2022.11.22.517517"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.11.22.517512", "title": "Mechanism of RanGTP priming the release of H2A-H2B from Kap114 and Importin-9", "authors": "Jiou, J.; Shaffer, J.

However, unlike most nuclear import systems where RanGTP dissociates cargoes from their importins, RanGTP binds stably to the Importin-9*H2A-H2B complex and formation of RanGTP*Importin-9*H2A-H2B facilitates H2A-H2B release to the assembling nucleosome (Padavannil et al. 2019). Here we show cryo-EM structures of Importin-9*RanGTP and of its yeast homolog Kap114, including Kap114*RanGTP, Kap114*H2A-H2B, and RanGTP*Kap114*H2A{-} H2B. In combination with hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis of Importin-9 complexes and nucleosome assembly assays, we explain how the conserved Kap114/Importin-9 importins bind H2A-H2B and RanGTP simultaneously and how the GTPase primes histone transfer to the nucleosome. We show that RanGTP binds to the N-terminal repeats of Kap114/Importin-9 as in Kap114/Importin-9*RanGTP, and H2A-H2B binds via its acidic patch to the Kap114/Importin-9 C{-} terminal repeats as in Kap114/Importin-9*H2A-H2B. RanGTP-binding in RanGTP*Kap114*H2A{-} H2B changes Kap114/Importin-9 conformation such that it no longer contacts the surface of H2A{-} H2B proximal to the H2A docking domain that drives nucleosome assembly, positioning it for transfer to the assembling nucleosome. The reduced affinity of RanGTP for Kap114/Importin-9 when H2A-H2B is bound may ensure release of H2A-H2B only at chromatin.", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/22/2022.11.22.517512"}]
